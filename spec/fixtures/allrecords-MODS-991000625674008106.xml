      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Updates to the underlying cost and environmental data have recently
                been implemented in the BIRDS database. This study evaluates the updated results for
                validation, as well as determines the potential changes in the results relative to
                those found in O'Rear, Webb, Kneifel and O'Fallon (1). The updates are found to have
                a minor impact on the total LCC and the LCA results, but there is a shift in some
                energy efficiency measures (EEMs) in optimal designs. The continued reduction in
                solar photovoltaic (PV) installation costs leads to larger system sizes being
                utilized in life-cycle cost (LCC) designs, while including few additional EEMs.
                Reducing the efficiency of some building components is possible and still reaching
                net-zero energy performance. As in the previous study, net-zero energy performance
                is reached at the lowest LCC using an all-electric design. The incremental increase
                in initial construction costs relative to the code-compliant design in Maryland is
                $28222, which has continued a trend in decreasing premium for net-zero energy
                performance. Over the 30-year study period, NZLCC-E saves the homeowner $34063.
                Although the homeowner could save more designing to meet the lowest LCC design using
                natural gas heating (LCC-NG), the additional savings is only $527 while still
                consuming about 50 % of the baseline building design s total energy. The concept of
                low-energy buildings must be reconsidered to determine whether new targets should be
                set, such as a combination of total consumption and net consumption or net-zero
                goals that include embodied energy. These results are limited in their
                generalization because they are based on a case study using validated simulation
                models of the NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF). The findings
                should not be extrapolated to buildings with different climates, energy costs,
                building codes, or occupancies. The assumptions on the economic analysis are also
                important factors to consider when using the results and implications in this study
                for decision making. The baseline building designs in this study are based on 2015
                IECC. Maryland has since adopted 2018 IECC, which would influence the relative
                differences between the optimal designs and the baseline.</abstract>
