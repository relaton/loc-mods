      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The report is a history of the Institute for Numerical Analysis (INA)
                with special emphasis on its research program during the period 1947 to 1956. The
                Institute for Numerical Analysis was located on the campus of the University of
                California, Los Angeles. It was a section of the National Applied Mathematics
                Laboratories, which formed the Applied Mathematics Division of the National Bureau
                of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology), under the
                U.S. Department of Commerce. The history of the program at INA is concerned
                primarily with the development of mathematics pertinent to solving numerical
                computations. The development could happen only if some mathematicians were
                proficient in handling the electronic digital computers. To insure that there would
                be some, INA was constituted. It was well funded, and could attract first class
                mathematicians to take a year off for research at INA. They were in the midst of
                people solving problems of considerable difficulty using digital computers. They
                were thus enticed into using them. When this happened, many important developments
                emerged. The history is centered around these people and discusses who they were,
                what their interests were, and what they did.</abstract>
