      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Two air-source, split system heat pumps were installed in a
                residential, net-zero energy home that was constructed as a laboratory on the campus
                of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg,
                Maryland USA. The first heat pump was a two-stage, 7 kW (2 ton), 15.8 seasonal
                energy efficiency ratio (SEER), 9.05 heating seasonal performance ratio (HSPF)
                conventionally ducted system, and the second heat pump was a variable-speed, 10.6 kW
                (3 ton), 14 SEER, 8.35 HSPF, high velocity ducted system. These two systems operated
                side-by-side, using separate supply ducts and a common return duct, on a weekly
                alternating schedule to condition the home that was operated with very consistent,
                simulated thermal loads. We wanted to know if the high velocity system could provide
                comparable energy use efficiency to the conventional system. The results of this
                study showed that it did meet the required loads while doing so with slightly
                greater efficiency; the average cooling coefficient of performance (COP) was
                (0.40+/-0.11) higher, and the average heating COP was statistically equal. A new
                firmware was provided at the end of the heating season which greatly improved the
                performance of the high velocity system; its average heating COP went from
                (1.8+/-0.9) to (2.5+/-1.1) at a 95 % confidence level. The new firmware heating COP
                averaged (1.05+/-0.23) higher than the old firmware over the same outdoor
                temperatures. Defrost performance is very different for these two systems yet they
                consumed equivalent energy per HDD; the conventional system uses a timed-initiate,
                temperature-terminate algorithm with auxiliary electric resistive heating while the
                high velocity system uses calculated evaporator parameters with a hot-gas bypass
                before a full reverse cycle defrost with no supplementary resistive heat.</abstract>
