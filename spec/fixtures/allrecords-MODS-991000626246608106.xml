      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel
                coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic. Following this announcement,
                school closures around the United States began, and starting in June 2020, many
                schools decided to reopen for the next academic year or were planning to reopen.
                Guidance from ASHRAE and other organizations for reoccupying school buildings
                include wearing masks, increasing ventilation, increasing filtration, and using
                portable air cleaners (PAC).This report describes a simulation study that: (1)
                compares the relative reduction in aerosol exposure in education spaces as a result
                of changes to the operation of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)
                systems and inclusion of non-HVAC controls (e.g., wearing of masks and operating
                PAC) and (2) estimates the uncertainties in effectiveness associated with these
                controls and combinations of controls. This analysis used Fate and Transport of
                Indoor Microbial Aerosols (FaTIMA), a tool developed by the National Institute of
                Standards and Technology (NIST), to evaluate aerosol exposure in ventilated spaces.
                FaTIMA was used to model the release of biological aerosols in two classrooms and an
                assembly room with four different types of HVAC systems, including central air
                handling systems (CAHS), dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS), terminal unit systems
                (TUS), and wall unit systems (WUS). Exposure was evaluated for 1 ?m particles (or
                aerosols) by which viruses are transported. In the classrooms, exposure was
                evaluated for 6 h of continuous exposure to a continuous source. In the assembly
                room, exposure was evaluated for 1 h of continuous exposure, where the source was
                present for the 5 h prior to the exposure period. For all the spaces and HVAC
                systems, the wearing of masks alone (assuming a protection efficiency of 25 % for
                both intake and exhalation) reduced exposure by 44 % relative to the base cases
                without masks. Masks with higher protection efficiencies (85 % to 90 %) reduced
                exposure 99 %, and masks with lower protection efficiencies reduced exposure 15 %.
                Masks with inhalation and exhalation protection efficiencies of 25 % combined with
                MERV 13 filtration in the HVAC systems reduced exposure by an average 71 % for the
                CAHS, DOAS, and TUS. For the CAHS, these masks combined with 100 % outdoor air (OA)
                intake reduced exposure by an average of 70 %. Using either a 297 clean air delivery
                rate (CADR) PAC or a 569 L?s-1 (1?200 cfm) exhaust fan with these masks, exposure
                was reduced by an average of 68 %. Combining all these controls, exposure was
                reduced by an average of 85 % assuming all controls were performing as intended. The
                results of this analysis may be useful in the selection of control options in
                educational facilities.</abstract>
