      <abstract displayLabel="Summary">During 1959 and I960 long-term transmission loss measurements were
                performed over a 223 kilometer path in Eastern Colorado using frequencies of 100 and
                751 Mc. This path intersects Pikes Peak which forms a knife-edge type obstacle
                visible from both terminals. The transmission loss measurements have been analyzed
                in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations in hourly medians and in instantaneous
                levels. As expected, results show that the long-term fading range is substantially
                less than expected for tropospheric scatter paths of comparable length. Transmission
                loss levels were in general agreement with predicted knife-edge diffraction
                propagation when allowance is made for rounding of the knife edge. A technique for
                estimating long-term fading ranges is presented and the results are in good
                agreement with observations. Short-term variations in some cases resemble the
                space-wave fadeouts commonly observed on within-the-horizon paths, although other
                phenomena may contribute to the fading. Since the foreground terrain was rough,
                there was no evidence of direct and ground-reflected lobe structure. In most cases
                comparatively high correlation exists between signals received simultaneously on two
                antennas with 8.3 and 14 meters vertical separation. These separations were chosen
                as being representative for practical space diversity systems designed for
                eliminating the effects of fading arising from direct and ground reflected phase
                interference phenomena. The comparatively high correlation observed suggests that
                space diversity will be relatively less successful in mountain obstacle paths with
                rough terrain near the terminals than on tropospheric scatter paths or on
                line-of-sight paths over smooth terrain. The enhancement of field strength
                associated with propagation over mountain ridges may cause concern in applications
                where mountains are being counted on to shield unwanted radio waves. Some radio
                astronomy installations have been located in mountain valleys for this reason, and
                it is possible that obstacle-gain effects may aggravate rather than alleviate
                interference.</abstract>
