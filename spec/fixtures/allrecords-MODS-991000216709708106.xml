      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) are ubiquitous indoors and
                associated with adverse health effects. y0 (the SVOC concentration in air close to
                the material surface) is the key parameter to predict SVOC emissions from source
                materials. However, to develop consensus standard methods for measuring y0, better
                understanding and validation of current approaches are needed. A solid-phase
                microextraction (SPME)-based method published in the literature was chosen for this
                study. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) from spray polyurethane foam (SPF)
                and Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flooring were
                chosen as target chemicals. First, TCPP concentrations in two SPF materials were
                measured. The values for open cell and closed cell SPF were 1.24 x 106 mg m-3 and
                2.84 x 105 mg m-3, respectively. Second, to apply the SPME-based method, an improved
                method to calibrate chemical mass collected on SPME fibers was evaluated. The
                results show that, for DEHP and Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the direct SPME loading method
                was able to calibrate masses collected on SPME fibers, but not for more volatile
                chemicals (TCPP and 2,2?,5,5?-Tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 52)). Unfortunately, the
                application of the improved direct loading method may be limited due to the need for
                evaluation of every target chemical, the physical challenge of spiking onto the
                fiber, and the variability of SPME fiber's adsorption ability. Third, y0 for DEHP
                from PVC flooring at different temperatures were measured using the SPME-based
                method and a specially designed stainless-steel chamber. However, due to the
                potential problems relating to the variability of SPME fiber's adsorption property,
                the variability of measured y0 values may be as large as a factor of two. Overall,
                given the essential drawbacks of SPME-based method for measuring y0, it is not yet
                suggested until the problems relating to SPME calibration and the variability of
                SPME fiber adsorption property are overcome.</abstract>
