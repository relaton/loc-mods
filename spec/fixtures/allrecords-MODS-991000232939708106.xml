      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">During the early months of 1961 the National Bureau of Standards
                established a 113 km tropospheric within-the-horizon path in Eastern Colorado in
                order to investigate propagation characteristics of signals in the 9300 Mc/s range
                over such a path. Special attention was given to the short-term fading
                characteristics of the received carrier envelopes, and to the bandwidth capability
                of the medium. The latter was studied by comparing the amplitude variations of two
                continuous-wave carriers separated by 100 Mc/s in the 9300 Mc/s frequency range.
                Separate antennas were used in transmission and reception of the two carriers;
                consequently, the results include the effects of space diversity. In addition to
                studying the correlation of carrier envelopes as a measure of the bandwidth
                capability, an analysis was also made of the distribution of the carrier amplitude
                ratios, which is related to the correlation coefficient, and is believed to be a
                better indicator, at least for line-of-sight paths, of selective fading phenomena.
                Short-term fading in the 9300 Mc/s range can be characterized in terms of prolonged
                space-wave fadeouts, which have previously been observed and described for lower
                carrier frequencies over this and similar paths. Fadeouts appear to be well
                correlated in time of occurrence on the two frequencies 9350 and 9350 Mc/s. The
                fading durations range from a few tenths of a minute to 10 minutes, and the maximum
                observed depth was 25 db below the median of a five-day observation period. The
                cross-correlation coefficient of instantaneous carrier envelopes separated by 100
                Me/s had an overall value of 0.91, as determined by sampling of the carrier
                amplitudes at the rate of one per second. The standard deviation of the amplitude
                ratios averaged 0.76 db, with a maximum hourly value of 1.81 db. These results
                support the feasibility of wide-band modulation techniques for within- the-horizon
                paths if evaluated by amplitude variations of discrete frequencies within the
                bandwidth of interest. Sufficient margin in transmitter power has to be provided to
                allow for the short-term signal variations observed. Supporting measurements on
                1040.1 Mc/s over this path confirmed previously established fadeout characteristics
                with regard to diurnal variations, depth, and duration of fadeouts. However, the
                distribution of hourly median signal levels on this frequency showed a much larger
                month-to-month variation than had previously been observed over this path. This is
                attributed to the small sample size available in the current measurement
                series.</abstract>
