      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This work presents an investigation into second-order effects on the
                wind-induced structural dynamic behavior of high-rise steel structure, as considered
                within a Database-assisted Design (DAD) context. A geometric stiffness method that
                accounts for second-order effects and allows the dynamic analysis to be performed
                without iterations is shown to be applicable in conjunction with DAD and is used in
                a study of the response of a 60-story building, known as the CAARC building.
                Datasets of the aerodynamic pressure on the CAARC building for suburban exposure are
                used to calculate overturning moments and shear forces at the base, as well as
                members' demand-to-capacity indexes (DCIs), inter-story drift ratios, and resultant
                accelerations. Dynamic analyses are performed using five reference mean hourly wind
                speeds at the rooftop for suburban terrain exposure (Uref = 20 m/s, 40 m/s, 60 m/s,
                80 m/s, and 100 m/s). The first three and the last three wind speeds are used in
                analyses for serviceability and strength, respectively. The second-order effects
                decrease natural frequencies of vibration of the building by up to 12 %. If the
                resonant response is not taken into account and for Uref = 80 m/s, second-order
                effects increase the non-directional peak base shears by up to 9 %, the torsional
                moments by up to 10 %, and the overturning moments by up to 15 %. If resonance is
                accounted for, (i) for Uref = 100 m/s normal to a building face, the vortex shedding
                frequency is close to the 2nd and the 3rd natural frequencies of the building, and
                those effects are increased by 40 % to 56 %; for Uref = 80 m/s and a typical set of
                21 structural members, the DCIs for the interaction of axial forces and bending
                moments, BijPM, are increased by up to 9 % for columns, 22 % for beams, and 19 % for
                diagonal bracings, while the DCIs for the shear forces, BijV are increased by up to
                33 % for columns, 14 % for beams, and 21 % for diagonal bracings; (iii) for Uref =
                60 m/s, second-order effects [...]</abstract>
