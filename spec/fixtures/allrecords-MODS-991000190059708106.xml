      <abstract displayLabel="Summary">In September 2013, an area of the Rocky Mountains region referred to
                as the Colorado Front Range experienced unprecedented rainfall that resulted in
                multiple days of flooding. This flooding caused significant damage to homes,
                commercial structures, roads, bridges, infrastructure systems, and parks and open
                space across the region, including Boulder County⁰₉s communities and mountain towns.
                Flooding, particularly flash flooding, is a primary hazard of concern in the region.
                The City of Boulder and Boulder County have implemented programs and preparedness
                measures to mitigate the risk, respond to, and recover from floods. Boulder County
                communities have been investing for decades to improve infrastructure systems, avoid
                development in hazard-prone areas, and implement financial and administrative
                programs to mitigate potential flooding damage. Government officials who had gained
                experience during the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Wildfire were also responsible for
                ensuring that their communities had the resources and support necessary to rebuild
                and restore community services after the 2013 flood. In the years since the 2013
                flood, communities have rebuilt and recovered with an emphasis on reducing future
                vulnerability. The collective experiences of those who helped prepare for and
                recover from the Boulder County flood are documented in this series of case studies
                of community resilience planning. The IDA Science and Technology Policy Institute,
                with support from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)
                Community Resilience Group, conducted case studies of Boulder County community
                resilience planning before, during, and after the 2013 flood. Three case studies
                focus on unincorporated Boulder County, the City of Boulder, and the towns of Lyons
                and Jamestown. A primary focus of the research was to document the recovery efforts
                within each case study; the programs, policies, or broader efforts employed by each
                community to design and construct resilient infrastructure; and the efforts to
                ensure community services (e.g., housing and public health) were provided throughout
                the multi-year recovery process. Research is based on publicly available literature,
                including reports published by Boulder County governments, and discussions with
                Boulder County community officials in 2015 and 2016.</abstract>
