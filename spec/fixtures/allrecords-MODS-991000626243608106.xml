      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Public safety is in the midst of a major transition in the
                communication technology that they use due to the ongoing development and deployment
                of the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN). Once established, the
                NPSBN will provide dedicated broadband to first responders. Having a dedicated
                network will allow first responders to leverage technology in performing their jobs
                safely, effectively, and efficiently. To fully recognize the benefits of having such
                a network, there has been many efforts to improve and create communication
                technology for first responders to work with this network. NIST's PSCR Usability
                team has been contributing to this effort by conducting a multi-year, mixed methods
                study to examine first responders' experiences with, problems with and needs of
                communication technology. The study consisted of two phases: in Phase 1, 193 first
                responders were interviewed, and in Phase 2, 7 182 first responders completed a
                survey of their communication technology experiences. Results of these efforts have
                been extensively reported on and are publicly available in eight reports. This
                report provides an in-depth statistical analysis of the survey data by exploring if
                and how communication technology problems and needs differ depending on the
                characteristics of the first responders. Specially, we examined differences by area
                (rural v. urban/suburban), role (frontline responders v. supervising responder, v.
                chief/management), and career v. volunteer status for fire service personnel. Two
                key themes emerged. First, we found that rural and volunteer first responders lack
                some devices and applications/software that their urban/suburban and career
                counterparts have, and they experience problems with the price of several devices.
                Second, we found that chief/management roles have different communication technology
                problems and needs from frontline first responders. Specifically, they tend to more
                often use devices and applications/software for coordination and managerial purposes
                and are very aware of the price of devices. This report provides a rich data and
                rigorous analysis for researchers, developers, and designers to use to inform their
                work in developing communication technology for first responders. We also describe
                how these findings relate to the user-centered guidelines published in previous
                reports.</abstract>
