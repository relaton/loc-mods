      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and others are
                concerned about the hazard of acute carbon monoxide (CO) exposures from portable
                gasoline powered generators that can result in death or serious adverse health
                effects in exposed individuals. As of May 15, 2015, the CPSC databases contain
                records of at least 702 deaths (involving 523 incidents) from CO poisoning in the
                U.S. caused by consumer use of a generator in the period of 2004 through 2014
                (Hnatov 2015). There were an additional 49 CO poisoning deaths (involving 39
                incidents) associated with consumer use of both a generator and at least one other
                CO-producing consumer appliance, for a total of 751 CO poisoning deaths (involving
                562 incidents) associated with generators for the same 11-year period. The majority
                of these deaths occurred when consumers used a generator in an enclosed or partially
                enclosed space or outdoors near an open door, window or vent. While avoiding the
                operation of such generators in or near an enclosed space is expected to reduce
                indoor CO exposures significantly, it may not be realistic to expect such usage to
                be eliminated completely. Another means of reducing these exposures would be to
                decrease the rate at which CO is emitted from these devices. A computer simulation
                study was conducted to provide CPSC staff with information to support comparisons of
                modeled residential CO exposures reflecting operation of current designs of portable
                engine-driven electric generators, inside homes or in attached garages. These
                results were compared to simulated operation of reduced emission generators meeting
                a potential CO emission rate limit performance requirement being considered by CPSC
                staff under portable generator rulemaking activities. These simulations employed the
                multizone airflow and contaminant transport model CONTAM, which was applied to a set
                of 40 buildings (consisting of 37 houses and 3 detached garages, considered broadly
                representative of fatal CO poisoning incidents reported in CPSC databases) that are
                primarily based on a collection of models representative of the U.S. housing stock.
                This report presents sample CO and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) simulation results for
                three of the houses and one of the garages modeled. The results presented
                demonstrate that generators with the reduced CO emission rates result in peak CO
                concentrations that can be reduced by 40 % to more than 90 % depending on the
                specific case being analyzed. The reduced CO emission rates also result in
                significant reductions in COHb in many cases. Additionally, use of a thermal
                building model coupled with the airflow and IAQ model to properly account for
                thermal effects was shown to be important as the interaction of the generators heat
                generation and the ambient weather conditions can significantly impact both air
                change rates and interzone airflow patterns in the buildings.</abstract>
