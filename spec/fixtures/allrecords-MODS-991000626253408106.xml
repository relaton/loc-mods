      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">To strengthen America s resilience, the Federal Government recognizes
                a need to reduce interruptions to services and jobs, and to lessen disruption to
                social and economic community functions after earthquake events. Current building
                codes and standards largely focus on saving lives. However, maintaining services and
                functionality will require new mechanisms that more effectively limit damage to
                buildings and lifelines infrastructure systems. In response to a U.S. Congressional
                mandate, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Federal
                Emergency Management Administration1 convened a Committee of Experts to recommend
                and assess options for improving post-earthquake reoccupancy and functional recovery
                time across the built environment. To inform the Committee of Experts and assist in
                their development of a report to Congress, stakeholder workshops were held in five
                cities across the country to gather information from subject matter experts and
                professionals in the earthquake community. This document details the processes for
                gathering input from stakeholders at workshops. It summarizes participants reactions
                to functional recovery concepts and options, particularly with respect to
                information that can help determine appropriate recovery times, as well as criteria
                for assessing various implementation options. In particular, workshop participants
                provided insights regarding which community functions were viewed as critical to
                postearthquake recovery, and when components of the built environment that support
                those functions would need to recover in order to maintain community stability.
                Generally, participants categorized components of the built environment important in
                the short term (hours and days) more consistently than the components slated for
                return in longer timeframes (weeks and months). Participants noted the importance of
                local values and community contexts to these assignments. Attendees were also asked
                to consider what factors a policy maker could use to effectively assess and compare
                options to improve functional recovery. Cost, benefit, feasibility, effectiveness,
                and equity were the five categories of evaluative criteria identified most clearly
                and frequently across attendees. Overall, participants supported the idea of
                developing a national framework for functional recovery, while emphasizing the
                importance of flexibility and adaptability of the framework such that it can be
                utilized as a tool for planning at the local level. Additional key themes
                stakeholders identified as important for inclusion in the report to Congress are
                detailed in Section 5. Input from a diversity of stakeholder perspectives gathered
                at the workshops were essential to help develop the concept of functional recovery
                and inform the report to Congress. In the future, additional feedback will be needed
                to develop specific resilience goals, set public policy, and prioritize the
                investment of resources to produce functional recovery performance.</abstract>
