      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Throughout the United States, the use of fiber reinforced (FR)
                composites in building and infrastructure applications has been steadily on the
                rise. FR composite materials, which include fiber reinforced polymer (FRP)
                composites and fiber reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites, are used to
                repair, strengthen, and seismically retrofit structural components (e.g., columns,
                beams, walls) of existing buildings and infrastructure. FR composite retrofits have
                become competitive with more traditional retrofit techniques due to their high
                strength, light weight, low profile, and corrosion resistance. These FR composite
                properties have resulted in lower overall costs and more efficient, less
                labor-intensive installation processes. Furthermore, repair, strengthening, and
                seismic retrofit of aging structures with FR composites leads to improved building
                and infrastructure resilience. Since the use of FR composites in the civil
                engineering field has matured, this report serves to review the state-of-the-art for
                FR composite performance and identify research needs requisite to advancing the
                field. The report focuses primarily on externally bonded FRP composites since they
                are most commonly used in practice in the United States. The research needs were
                obtained by an extensive literature review and from input received at a national
                stakeholder workshop at NIST in 2018. The findings of this report describe the
                materials and structural level research needs prioritized per the subject matter
                expert opinions received at the workshop. Major materials research needs include
                improvement of inspector certification processes and improvement or development of
                test methods that assess the condition of FR composites after installation and
                long-term use. Other major research needs include identification of bond degradation
                mechanisms between FRP composites and concrete and relation of accelerated
                conditioning protocols to long-term exposure outdoors. Structural research needs
                include development of design standards and guidelines for FR retrofitted components
                and buildings, improvement of inspection practices, structural-scale experimental
                studies, and improvement of numerical modeling capabilities. This report is intended
                to inform future research plans developed by various stakeholders concerning the
                performance of buildings and infrastructure that are retrofitted or repaired with FR
                composites.</abstract>
