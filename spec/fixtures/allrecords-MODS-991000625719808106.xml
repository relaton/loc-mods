      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report documents the design and performance of a
                second-generation phi meter used in multi-scale experimental applications. A
                constructed second-generation phi meter is implemented in bench and 2/5th scale
                experiments to demonstrate the instrument s ability to conduct global and local
                equivalence ratio measurements and gas species concentrations of combustion products
                (i.e., carbon dioxide, water vapor, and oxygen) without knowledge of the sampled
                fuel composition. Bench-scale experiments evaluated the second-generation phi meter
                s functionality by introducing known fuel-air ratios into the instrument and
                verifying measurements via the carbon to hydrogen ratio and mass balance. The
                bench-scale experiments selected methane, propane, and propene as the fuels of
                interest. The 2/5th scale experiments implemented two second-generation phi meters
                in a series of 25 kW methane backdraft experiments. Backdraft experiments provided
                an ideal setting to test the phi meter s performance by subjecting the instrument to
                a transient heterogeneous gas mixture. The phi meters sampling location was
                positioned such that the extracted gas samples fed into the instrument were unknown.
                Global and local equivalence ratio measurements made in the 2/5th scale compartment
                were compared to independent gas analyzer and gas chromatograph measurements. In the
                bench-scale experiments, the global equivalence ratio, water vapor concentration,
                and carbon to hydrogen ratio measurements are in fair agreement with their expected
                values. Real-time global and local equivalence ratio and carbon to hydrogen ratio
                measurements obtained during a backdraft experiment were observed to increase as the
                fuel concentration within the 2/5th scale compartment increased. Real-time global
                and local equivalence ratios were verified by the independent
                instrumentation.</abstract>
