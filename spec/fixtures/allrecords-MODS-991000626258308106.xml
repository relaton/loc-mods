      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report documents work performed by the U.S. National Institute
                of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
                (CPSC or Commission) under an interagency agreement in support of the Commission's
                effort to address the carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning hazard associated with consumer
                use of portable generators. This report documents the plan, developed by NIST and
                CPSC staff, for a computer simulation study performed by NIST and provides examples
                of the study results. CPSC staff will use the study's results to evaluate the
                effectiveness of CO hazard mitigation requirements that were adopted in two
                voluntary standards in 2018. These two ANSI-approved standards are ANSI/PGMA
                G300-2018, Safety and Performance of Portable Generators (referred to as PGMA G300)
                and UL 2201, Standard for Carbon Monoxide (CO) Emission Rate of Portable Generators,
                Second Edition (referred to as UL 2201). Both voluntary standards have requirements
                for a system that will shut the generator off when specific CO concentrations are
                present near the generator. PGMA G300 also has other requirements, including a
                notification to the user after the generator has shut off, while UL 2201 has a
                reduced CO emission rate requirement. The methodology of the simulation study was
                largely similar to that used by CPSC staff to evaluate the benefits of the proposed
                rule issued by the Commission in 2016 to address the hazard of CO poisoning from
                portable generators. This simulation study used the same forty buildings, weather
                conditions, and generator characteristics to study the rate at which the CO emitted
                from the generator accumulates in, transports within, and leaves the homes and
                detached garages for generators with and without the CO mitigation requirements
                prescribed in the voluntary standards. The plan involved performing approximately
                140,000 simulations using NIST's indoor air quality modeling program CONTAM. This
                report presents the simulation plan and detailed CO and COHb simulation results for
                sample scenarios from two of the houses and one of the detached garages. Note: At
                the request of CPSC staff, NIST staff performed additional simulations using a 15 %
                longer run time for UL 2201 generators in a subset of the house models. These
                simulations are documented with sample results in new Appendix D of this
                report.</abstract>
