      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">A high-level review was conducted of design criteria in the United
                States for major components of the built environment for selected design and
                construction codes, reference standards, and best practices. The intent of the
                review is to gauge the expected performance of current building and infrastructure
                design from a community resilience perspective for natural hazard events. Design
                criteria that support community resilience were evaluated, including design hazard
                characterization, expected performance, recovery of function, interdependency
                issues, and emerging methods. The impact of changing environmental conditions on
                infrastructure design and performance was also examined, and areas needing
                improvement are identified. The review focused on design criteria related to flood,
                wind, and seismic hazards. Likewise, the systems of the built environment reviewed
                include buildings, water and wastewater systems, electrical power systems, and
                transportation systems. Although community resilience depends on the performance of
                existing buildings and infrastructure, this report focuses on design criteria for
                new construction to inform future codes, standards, regulations, and best practices.
                Technical topics to improve the performance and recovery of the built environment
                for a range of hazard types and to advance the methods and tools available to
                support resilient systems and communities for stakeholders are identified. The
                target audience of this report includes industry associations, design professionals,
                community building code officials, community and city planners, and
                researchers.</abstract>
