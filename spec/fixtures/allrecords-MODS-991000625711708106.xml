      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In the last twenty years, wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires have
                been growing in severity and size. The structures destroyed by WUI fires have
                devastated entire communities and have cost billions of dollars while significantly
                impacting the social fabric and economic well-being of entire regions. Structural
                losses have been attributed to exposures from embers (firebrands) and fire
                (radiation and/or convection). As structural losses continue to increase, there is
                need for a comprehensive hazard assessment and mitigation methodology to harden
                appropriate structures and parcels effectively and efficiently against ember and
                fire exposures. The Hazard Mitigation Methodology (HMM) described in this report was
                developed explicitly to meet these needs. The science-based methodology uses the
                knowledge collected from post-fire field observations spanning over a dozen years
                and tens of thousands of hours of field data integration and analysis. Additionally,
                the HMM utilizes the latest technical knowledge gained from laboratory and
                large-scale research in fire propagation and hazard mitigation in the WUI. The HMM
                is the result of a sixteen-month collaborative effort between NIST, the California
                Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), and the Insurance Institute
                for Business and Home Safety (IBHS). The HMM is a spatial hazard mitigation
                methodology that provides an implementable path forward by considering the spatial
                relationships of fuels and exposures and hardening at the structure and parcel
                levels. The HMM demonstrates how complex structure hardening is, and how and why
                hazards associated with both fire and ember exposures need to be mitigated. The
                methodology further demonstrates where structure hardening in the absence of parcel
                hardening does not work by highlighting the relationships between exposure and
                hardening. Housing density, structure separation distance, and parcel layouts are
                also addressed. The methodology was explicitly designed to address the current
                building stock, i.e., to solve the retrofit challenges, and efforts were made to
                limit retrofit expenses. While the methodology was developed primarily for
                retrofits, the presented strategy can also be applied to new construction. This
                report documents the methodology and addresses the critical issues of mitigation
                effectiveness at the parcel and community levels. The impacts of partial mitigation
                at the parcel and community level were addressed for different types of WUI
                communities.</abstract>
