      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">As an exploratory analysis, demographic data from the 2000 Census and
                2011 American Community Survey at the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code level are
                used in conjunction with damage estimates from the Federal Emergency Management
                Agency (FEMA) to model the effects of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season on Florida.
                Data on the number of establishments by industry and ZIP code were obtained from the
                Census County Business Patterns datasets. To prevent the 2007 to 2009 recession from
                adding a convoluting effect, a time period from 2000 to 2006 was selected. The
                analysis also assumes that the 2004 season was a distinct and severe enough event
                that its impacts are distinguishable from general trends in the data. Analysis was
                also broken into coastal regions and inland regions to lessen any possible
                endogeneity. The change in the number of establishments was selected as the
                independent variable as specific data on closures and the reasons why were
                unavailable. A difference in differences, as well as a graphical, analysis on the
                change in number of establishments indicate reasons to view 2004 as a significant
                event, however due to the multitude of convoluting factors affecting a state's
                economy it is impossible to attribute the full effect to the 2004 season. Fixed
                effect regressions using first differences were also run looking at the impact of
                demographic factors on the change in number of establishments. Regression results
                were rendered inconsistent by an endogeneity issue; however the general method here
                did produce interesting results when incorporating time-fixed effects. The
                regression results imply demographics have a mixed impact; bearing in mind the
                estimator was inconsistent due to endogeneity. Overall the developed process seems
                viable for use in other instances, provided more complete data is
                available.</abstract>
