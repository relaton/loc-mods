      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">For some 6,000 years, humans have made an indelible mark on history
                through the loops, strokes, and other characters that constitute the written form of
                language - handwriting. The study of handwriting is also an important part of
                forensic science. By analyzing the characteristics of a handwritten note or
                signature, a trained forensic document examiner may be able to extract valuable
                information for determining whether a note or signature is genuine, as well as the
                likely writer. As with all human endeavors, handwriting examination is not immune to
                errors. In June 2015, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology convened
                the Expert Working Group for Human Factors in Handwriting Examination to conduct a
                scientific assessment of the effects of human factors on forensic handwriting
                examination with the goal of recommending strategies and approaches to improve its
                practice and reduce the likelihood of errors. This report provides a comprehensive
                discussion of how human factors relate to all aspects of handwriting examinations
                including communicating conclusions to all relevant parties through reports and
                testimony. The report also discusses education, training, and certification as well
                as the role of quality assurance, quality control, and management in reducing
                errors.</abstract>
