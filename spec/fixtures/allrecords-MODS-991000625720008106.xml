      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The National Institute of Standards and Technology is currently
                conducting a series of large compartment fire tests to investigate the behavior and
                fire-induced failure mechanisms of the full-scale composite floor assemblies with
                the two-story steel gravity frame, two bays by three bays in plan. This report
                presents the experimental design and results from the second fire experiment (Test
                #2) conducted at the National Fire Research Laboratory. The Test #2 was aimed to
                investigate the influence of the slab reinforcement on the structural integrity of
                the 9.1 m 6.1 m steel-concrete composite floor subjected to combined mechanical
                loads and compartment fire exposure. The fire test bay was situated on the ground
                floor in the middle edge bay of the two-story test building. The floor slab in the
                test bay was reinforced with the No.3 deformed bars placed 30 cm on center (230
                mm2/m). The test floor was hydraulically loaded to 2.7 kPa to mimic the
                code-prescribed gravity loads for fire conditions. The natural gas burners created a
                peak gas temperature exceeding 1100 C below the test floor. The test fire lasted
                about 131 min, but the hydraulic loading was not removed until the test floor cooled
                down over 2 hours. This experimental study confirmed that the steel reinforcement
                played a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the composite floor under
                prolonged compartment fire exposure. The mid-panel vertical displacement increased
                at a rate less than 1 mm/ C as the protected steel beams were heated to 850 C on
                average. The peak vertical displacement of the test slab was recorded 475 mm
                surpassing the displacement limit prescribed in the standard fire test. Although the
                test slab developed extensive surface cracks, it successfully contained the test
                fire underneath while sustaining the imposed loads simultaneously. The test floor
                retained the post-fire flexural strength exceeding 90 % of the ambient design
                strength of the composite secondary beam prior to fire exposure. The experimental
                results presented in this report can be used for validation of predictive models to
                perform parametric studies incorporating the variability in the steel reinforcement
                scheme (area, spacing, and material) for safer and cost-effective composite floor
                construction for fire safety.</abstract>
