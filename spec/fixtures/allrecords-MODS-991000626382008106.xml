      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In the fall of 2019, the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) funded threes studies to better understand equity and inclusivity.
                This report documents phase two of a three phased sequential, exploratory mixed
                methods study designed to provide an in-depth look at the population of NIST federal
                employees to identify factors, attitudes, and processes that might result in gender-
                specific barriers at NIST. Phase 1 analyzed human resources demographic data,
                compensation data, and performance data of NIST federal employees from 2011 to 2019
                to determine any relevant trends. Phase 1 informed the development of an in-depth
                interview protocol designed to identify the differences, if any, in the ways in
                which men and women experience work at NIST. A total of 40 (36 female and 4 male)
                participants were interviewed. Three interconnected themes emerged in the data: 1) a
                culture at NIST that creates a Chilly Climate for women; 2) gendered experiences
                that contribute to and are outcomes of that chilly climate; and 3) gendered outcomes
                that influence women s experiences in the organization. The culture has evolved from
                NIST s scientific roots, scientific excellence, a strong belief in meritocracy, and
                as a Federal agency. Each of these characteristics contribute to a gendered social
                structure and the perception that change is not needed. This backdrop sets the stage
                for the characterizations of NIST from the interviews as a Boys Club and an Elitist
                environment. The radically different perspectives of men and women based in the
                culture result in experiences and outcomes that provide advantages and opportunities
                for men while erecting barriers to survival for women, including isolation and
                possibly exclusion. These barriers result in consequences of discrimination as well
                as lack of trust and resignation. Participant quotes are used as exemplars to
                provide details related to each of these themes. Overall, the interviews demonstrate
                that women and men experience a very different NIST.</abstract>
