      <abstract displayLabel="Summary">Every day, overweight and excessively heavy vehicles cause damage to
                roads, bridges, and other vehicle-based infrastructure. To protect the vital
                transportation infrastructure for the U.S., states have imposed weight limits for
                commercial and fleet transport vehicles. A common way for enforcing these weight
                limits is to guide trucks off the road to weigh stations where the vehicles can be
                weighed using static truck scales. A disadvantage of these dedicated weigh stations
                is that they take up a substantial amount of space (which is not always available)
                and time to conduct weighments, as well as cause delays to traffic flow that may
                impede commerce based on truck transport. A solution to these problems is the use of
                high-speed weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems that are installed in the road and weigh
                vehicles as they pass by while maintaining their speed. For jurisdictions to
                effectively use a WIM system for direct enforcement of weight limits, the system
                must be evaluated against a recognized standard to establish suitability for its
                intended application. The vast majority of weighing instruments used for legal
                metrology purposes (including law enforcement) need to comply with the requirements
                in NIST Handbook 44 Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for
                Weighing and Measuring Devices. However, the NIST Handbook 44 does not (yet) cover
                WIM systems for direct enforcement. Although state and local jurisdictions use NIST
                Handbook 44 to certify legal metrological instruments, it does not exclude
                jurisdictions from using additional technical standards to certify certain
                instruments. New York City recently certified a WIM system to protect a critical
                section of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) by designating it as a pilot project
                while efforts were made to amend NIST Handbook 44 to include WIM systems for direct
                enforcement. This publication discusses the main characteristics of WIM systems and
                how they can be used for direct enforcement. An overview of several alternative
                documentary standards that can be applied for certification of WIM systems is also
                provided, with further explanation regarding how the New York City Department of
                Transportation (NYCDOT) implemented the certification of the WIM system to begin
                issuing citations to overweight vehicles in an effort to protect the BQE.</abstract>
