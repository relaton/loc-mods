      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In the fall of 2019, the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) funded threes studies to better understand equity and inclusivity.
                The present study represents phase three of a sequential, exploratory mixed methods
                study designed to provide an in- depth look at the population of NIST federal
                employees to identify factors, attitudes, and processes that might result in gender-
                specific barriers at NIST. From phase 1 and the phase 2 in-depth interview
                qualitative results an on-line survey was designed to quantify the differences, if
                any, in the ways in which men and women experience work at NIST. The target
                population was all NIST federal employees, approximately 3,300. The sample size was
                1,350, approximately 30 % of the sampling frame. The survey consisted of six
                sections and was disseminated by email to the sampling frame. Participation was
                completely voluntary. The survey was open for three weeks. 1,529 employees responded
                to the survey for an overall response rate of 33.2 % and 1,108 completed the survey
                (resulting in an overall completion rate of 72.5 %). Survey participants
                demographics were representative of the overall distribution of staff across
                Directorates, Operating Units, age, years of service, career paths, pay bands, and
                educational levels. The chi-square test for independence was used to test for
                statistically significant differences between the NIST population and the survey
                respondents as a whole, as well as between men and women. Statistically significant
                differences ( &lt; 0.001) were found for men and women with respect to the
                organization's commitment to diversity and inclusivity (men are more positive than
                women) , on meritocracy (more women believe opportunities are based on who you know
                rather than most deserving employees) , and gendered experiences of being
                interrupted in meeting, questioning competence, and not receiving credit for ideas.
                More women believe they have to work harder, wait longer for promotion and
                opportunities for leadership. More women reported considering leaving NIST than
                their male counterparts. Both women and men agree they have equal opportunity to be
                hired, their need for work life balance is supported, that teamwork is valued, and
                NIST believes it is more objective than subjective and that projects are not more
                important than staff. Overall, the survey results align with the qualitative results
                and provide quantitative data on the differences in which men and women experience
                the culture, diversity and inclusivity of NIST.</abstract>
