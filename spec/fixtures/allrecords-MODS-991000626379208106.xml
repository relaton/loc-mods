      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In January 2000, Noah Kalina began taking a photograph of himself
                every day and has continued for more than 20 years. A time-lapse video of his images
                can be seen online: EveryDay. These images, and images from similar projects,
                provide us with interesting opportunities to explore the effects of time lapse on
                iris recognition employed on images that were not originally intended for iris
                recognition. NIST obtained a license from Kalina to use a subset (7 half years from
                2009-2015) of original, high resolution, digital images in biometric studies. This
                paper is our first published analysis of those images. Our license does not permit
                redistribution of the high resolution images. Our analysis demonstrates that over a
                period of at least 6 years, even though the majority of the images in this dataset
                did not provide solid matches, there are instances where mated iris image pairs from
                visible light images that were not obtained for the purpose of iris recognition
                match with match scores corresponding to a false match rate of 0:1% at a true accept
                rate of 1% . Though such performance is not useful in applications such as access
                control, there are cases where it may be useful. We note that the algorithms used in
                this analysis were not designed to work with the iris images that we extracted from
                the EveryDay project.</abstract>
