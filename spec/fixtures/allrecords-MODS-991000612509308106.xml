      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">NIST Handbook 130 includes a compilation of model laws and
                regulations and related interpretations and guidelines designed to encourage
                uniformity in adoption and implementation of weights and measures laws and
                regulations. The model laws and regulations included in NIST Handbook 130 are
                adopted in various forms by many state, local, and some federal weights and measures
                authorities. Some authorities adopt the current versions as written; some use them
                as the basis of adoption, but from an earlier year; some use them as a guideline
                only; some elect to use their own laws or regulations; and some have no
                corresponding law or regulation in place. The National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) has a statutory responsibility to promote "cooperation with the
                states in securing uniformity in weights and measures laws and method of inspection”
                and publishes this and other NIST Handbooks in partial fulfillment of this
                responsibility. This 2023 edition includes amendments made through the Committee on
                Laws and Regulations of the NCWM with technical guidance from the Office of Weights
                and Measures (OWM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and
                input from weights and measures officials and industry representatives. These
                amendments were adopted by the NCWM at its 107th Annual Meeting in July 2022. At the
                1983 Annual Meeting, the NCWM voted to change the title of Handbook 130 from “Model
                State Laws and Regulations” was to be changed to “Uniform Laws and Regulations” to
                reflect that these Laws and Regulations are (a) intended to be standards rather than
                just guidelines, and (b) intended for adoption by political subdivisions other than
                states when deemed appropriate. In 1995 the title was changed to Uniform Laws and
                Regulations in the areas of legal metrology and motor fuel quality. In the 1997
                Edition of Handbook 130 was changed from "Uniform Laws and Regulations the words
                “motor fuel quality" was changed to “engine fuel quality" to reflect changes made to
                the Uniform Engine Fuels, Petroleum Products, and Automotive Lubricants Law and
                Regulation. In 2018, the scope of the Fuels regulation was expanded to encompass the
                changing fuels in the marketplace, and the title to the Handbook was changed to how
                it appears today.</abstract>
