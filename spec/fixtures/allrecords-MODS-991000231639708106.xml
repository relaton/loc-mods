      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Between 2005 and 2016, US multifactor productivity declined an
                average 0.3 % annually. Some debate has ensued about the cause of this decline or
                whether there even was a decline in productivity. One aspect of productivity that is
                neglected in the literature is the effect of flow time on production and
                productivity. This paper examines the impact that innovations in material, finished
                goods, and work-in-process flow time have on productivity and production, measured
                using the multifactor productivity index and manufacturing value added. Using data
                on US manufacturing from 2005 to 2015, 12 regression models are presented and 19
                simulations are developed to examine the impact of flow time on productivity and
                value added. The flow time for work-in-process goods and that for inventories is
                examined. The results suggest that flow time innovations have a significant impact
                on multifactor productivity and production. That is, manufacturers can increase
                productivity through flow time or lose productivity through increases in flow time,
                as might be expected. The more significant findings are in regards to the magnitude
                of impact of flow time. A simulated 20 % decrease in work-in-process flow time
                results in a 1.21 % increase in multifactor productivity and a 2.23 % increase in
                value added. A simulated 20 % decrease in material and finished goods flow time
                increases productivity by 0.29 % and increases value added by 2.80 %. These changes
                may seem small; however, the average industry s work-in-process flow time from 2005
                to 2015 increased 98.8 %. During this same period, multifactor productivity declined
                an average of 2.2 %. If flow time had remained unchanged from 2005, however,
                multifactor productivity would have increased between 1.73 % and 3.38 % through
                other factors, according to our model.</abstract>
