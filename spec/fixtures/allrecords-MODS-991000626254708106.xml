      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Operations management systems manage flows of work, resources, and
                information through production and logistics systems, ensuring the correct and
                efficient execution of requested work. These systems can leverage recent advances in
                data availability, analytical capabilities, and industrial automation to
                substantially improve overall system performance. Additional improvements include
                streamlining flows of work, resources, and information across functionally
                heterogeneous components of production and logistics systems, which often have their
                own planning, execution, and data management systems. These smart manufacturing
                capabilities may simplify system implementation and improve its operation. However,
                they also introduce additional complexity to the system and design process. This
                paper proposes a model of operational control capable of supporting an integrated
                approach to design, analysis, and operation across functionally heterogeneous
                systems, classified as discrete event logistics systems. The model identifies and
                formalizes operational control decision-making and actuation functions required by
                these systems. It then provides logical modeling components that can be reused,
                specialized, and assembled into operational control system models. These models can
                be linked and integrated with other models and views of the system as part of an
                overall model-based engineering effort.</abstract>
