      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report describes the experiments conducted during the first
                phase of a multi-phase project designed to assess structure-to-structure fire spread
                for structures in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). The experiments focused on
                quantifying thermal exposures from auxiliary structures, e.g., sheds. The effects of
                shed sizes, construction materials, fuel loading, and separation distance on the
                ignition of primary structures (residential dwellings) with no wind have been
                studied and reported. Preliminary structure separation experiments using natural gas
                burners and an instrumented target structure were conducted to optimize
                instrumentation and experimental design for shed burn experiments. Full-scale fire
                experiments were conducted in which various sizes and types of sheds were used to
                generate typical radiative and convective heat exposures. Experiments were conducted
                indoors at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to quantify
                exposures from small source structures (sheds) in terms of mass loss rate (MLR) and
                heat release rate (HRR). HRR was measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry.
                Large and very large sheds were tested outdoors at the Insurance Institute for
                Business &amp; Home Safety (IBHS) test facility. The mass loss method was employed
                to estimate the HRR for the outdoor shed burns. In addition, indoor shed burn
                experiments with a target structure were conducted to assess target performance
                against exposures from varying sheds (construction, size, fuel loading) and
                separation distances. All experiments were performed without an artificially
                generated wind field. The preliminary experiments helped troubleshoot and provided
                insights into the airflow bias effects within the indoor test facility. The indoor
                shed burn experiments demonstrated that the mass loss measurements can be used to
                infer HRR measurements. The peak HRR (PHRR) was a function of construction
                materials, shed size, and fuel loading. Heat fluxes were measured and the effects of
                the burning shed on the target structure were documented under no-wind conditions as
                a function of separation distance, construction materials, shed size, fuel loading,
                and shed openings. The mass loss method was used to infer HRR for from very large
                auxiliary structures tested outdoors at the IBHS test facility. Generally, for a
                given shed size and fuel loading, the PHRR, which is related to the fire hazard,
                depended on the shed construction material. Combustible shed source structures
                generated a greater PHRR than non-combustible sheds, almost by a factor of 4. The
                exposures quantified in this study demonstrate that any auxiliary structures made
                from combustible materials can pose a significant fire hazard when placed next to
                the primary structure. For non-combustible source structures, the shed orientation
                with respect to the primary structure and the size of the door opening are critical
                factors. Sheds and auxiliary structures exceeding 120 ft2 floor area are subject to
                placement requirements with respect to residential structure(s) on the same lot
                through Chapter 7A of the California Building Code. The location and spacing of
                smaller sheds (e.g., under 120 ft2) may or may not be regulated and current codes
                often allow these smaller sheds to be as close as 5 ft from a residence or property
                line. The findings from this study can provide technical input for national, state,
                and local building codes to alleviate fire spread from auxiliary structures within
                WUI communities.</abstract>
