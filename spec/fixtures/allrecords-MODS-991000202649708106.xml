      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The performance of a building and its functionality after a natural
                hazard event depend on multiple factors, including the original design and the
                current condition and capacity of the building to resist the risks posed by hazards.
                Building functionality also depends on the condition of the supporting
                infrastructure and the availability of utilities supplied to the building. Rapid
                recovery or uninterrupted operation of buildings can minimize disruptions to the
                community, decrease costs associated with repair and rebuilding, and lessen the
                overall economic burdens on communities and individuals impacted by natural hazards.
                However, given the range of age and condition of buildings across a community, there
                are often situations where the built environment does not perform well during
                natural hazard events. To address this gap between current and desired performance
                of buildings, Congress tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology
                (NIST) to identify research needs and implementation activities that would help
                improve building performance in case of a natural hazard. This mandate would expand
                the application of immediate occupancy performance beyond critical buildings, such
                as hospitals, to other buildings that are important to residents, businesses, and
                the broader community. With a longstanding focus on preserving lives, building codes
                help reduce the likelihood of significant damage or structural collapse and provide
                some degree of property protection. But current codes generally do not address
                continued functionality after a hazard event. With the damage and losses the nation
                and communities have been experiencing following natural hazard events, there is
                interest in understanding what would be required to move beyond the current design
                paradigm to include functionality. For example, an apartment building may be
                uninhabitable after an earthquake due to expected structural damage or after a wind
                hazard event due to damage to the building envelope. The resulting economic and
                social disruption caused by the displacement of residents is significant and is
                compounded when residential and commercial buildings across the community are
                similarly damaged. To address this problem and move toward development of a new
                immediate occupancy performance objective, this report identifies a large portfolio
                of research and implementation activities that target enhanced performance
                objectives for residential and commercial buildings. This exploratory report
                provides information about steps that could be taken; NIST is not charged with
                making recommendations about the desirability, practicality, or government or
                private sector resources that would be needed to carry out these actions if a
                decision is made to give immediate occupancy greater attention. These potential
                activities developed by NIST were aided by a steering committee of individual
                experts and informed by additional stakeholder input, including a national workshop
                hosted by NIST in January 2018. Four primary topic areas were identified: 1)
                building design, 2) community considerations, 3) economic and social considerations,
                and 4) acceptance and adoption considerations. If a decision is made to advance
                immediate occupancy performance goals, these topics need to be addressed
                concurrently through cooperative efforts among researchers, engineers, standards and
                code officials, and community stakeholders to reach the next level of building
                design and performance.</abstract>
