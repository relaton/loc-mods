      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Spray polyurethane foam (SPF) insulation increases building energy
                efficiency by reducing conductive and convective heat losses through the building
                envelope and is used in both new construction and retrofit applications. Health
                complaints relating to emissions from SPF installations have spurred a joint
                industry and federal effort to develop standard methods to quantify airborne
                emissions from SPF. As part of this effort, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
                (CPSC) tasked the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with
                developing testing and measurement protocols to determine the quantities and
                properties of compounds released from SPF, such as amine catalysts and aldehydes, as
                it is applied in residential settings. Specifically, this effort examined if
                micro-chamber emission results can be used to determine concentrations in indoor
                environments and to quantify the emissions from a SPF sample that was applied in a
                potentially non-ideal manner. The data demonstrate that emissions from SPF are
                chemical, temperature, flow, and foam type dependent. Micro-chamber data can be used
                to compare chemical emission profiles from various foams, but micro-chamber emission
                rates for flame retardants cannot be directly applied to full scale emissions in a
                building. The results from examining SPF in a residential test home suggest that
                occupants may be exposed to measureable concentrations of the flame retardant tris
                (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCPP) two years after application of open cell foam.
                CPSC submitted a SPF sample suggestive of being applied in a non-ideal manner. When
                the submitted SPF was tested in the micro-chamber, over 17 different chemicals were
                identified with a spectrum match, seven of which had not been previously identified
                in literature emitting from other foams. Of the chemicals for which concentrations
                were quantified in the micro-chamber experiments, triethylenediamine concentrations
                were the highest. The emission rates of six chemicals were quantified from the SPF.
                The emission rates of all chemicals except for TCPP decreased in a negative
                exponential manner. More information on chemicals emitted from SPF in buildings are
                needed to determine if the tested foam is indeed a misapplied foam. Emission rates
                in this document apply only to micro-chamber conditions. This data should not be
                used to predict full-scale emissions until further testing has determined mass
                transfer parameters.</abstract>
