      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The NIST Outdoor Structure Separation Experiments are part of the
                NIST Structure Separation Experiments project, which is designed to assess
                structure-to-structure fire spread in the wildland-urban interface. In the first
                phase of this project, fire exposures from small source structures (sheds) were
                quantified in terms of mass loss rate and peak heat release rate in the absence of
                wind. The performance of a target structure representing a residential façade was
                assessed in response to exposures from a variety of sheds (differing in
                construction, size, and fuel loading) and separation distances. These experiments
                were conducted indoors at the National Fire Research Laboratory at NIST. The
                knowledge gained from the indoor shed burn experiments was used to develop the
                outdoor shed burn experiments.This report describes a series of outdoor shed burn
                experiments conducted at NIST to study the effects of applied wind on thermal
                (radiant and convective) exposures from variety of sheds to a target structure. The
                results were used to determine the minimum Structure Separation Distance (SSDmin),
                which is defined as the shortest distance between the source (storage shed) and
                target structure (residence) to prevent ignition and flame spread. Experiments were
                conducted with combustible (wood) and noncombustible (steel) sheds, each containing
                a set of wood cribs and ignited to generate typical radiative and convective heat
                exposures to the target structure. The target structure was an assembly including an
                exterior wall with a window and a roof with a vented eave. Effects of shed
                orientation, shed size, SSD, and shed type on thermal exposure to the target
                structure were studied. The thermal exposure was quantified in each case by
                measuring the peak heat flux and temperature at the target structure. Based on
                target structure performances due to thermal exposure from the burning of different
                source structures, a SSDmin was identified. The experiments in this study
                demonstrated good reproducibility of experimental data. The wind had complex effects
                on the burning behavior of wood sheds, affecting flame lengths and convective heat
                transfer to the target structure. For combustible sheds, the peak heat flux measured
                at the target structure corresponded with the total amount of fuel was not affected
                by orientation (i.e., door opening facing downwind or upwind). In the case of steel
                sheds with the door opening facing the target structure, the applied wind had
                minimal or no effect on thermal exposure to the target structure. The steel sheds
                contained the fire effectively – thus reducing, but not eliminating, the thermal
                exposure to the target structure. For the scenarios evaluated, peak heat flux at the
                target structure could be reduced by half by changing the orientation of the door
                opening for noncombustible sheds. The SSDmin was identified as 10 ft for combustible
                and noncombustible sheds with floor area less than 26 ft2 in scenarios with a fire
                hardened target structure. For sheds with floor area between 26 ft2 and 64 ft², the
                minimum SSDmin was found to be 15 ft. Because the local winds during a WUI fire are
                unpredictable, SSD should be omnidirectional, i.e., the same SSD in all directions.
                12 out of the 13 experiments were conducted with a fire hardened target structure.
                Experiment conducted with a non-fire hardened target structure to demonstrate the
                effectiveness of fire hardening revealed that the non-fire hardened structure
                ignited within 6 mins when exposed to a Very Small wood shed with total fuel of 212
                kg and SSD of 10 ft. With similar thermal exposure, and SSD, the fire hardened
                target structure exhibited minimal thermal damage and significant ignition
                resistance. Acknowledging the limitations of the experimental series, implementation
                of the minimum separation distance identified from the experimental measurements in
                this study is expected to improve community resilience to WUI.</abstract>
