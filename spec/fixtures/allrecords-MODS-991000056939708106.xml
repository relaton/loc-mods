      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Immediately following the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake of
                October 17, 1989, a team representing the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in
                Construction surveyed the damage to buildings, utilities and transportation
                structures. The report is based primarily on the data gathered during the site
                survey and the results of preliminary analyses of structural failures. Most
                structures designed in accordance with modern codes and standards performed well
                without serious structural damage. However, there were many concrete and masonry
                buildings and highway structures in the San Francisco Bay area which were not
                designed according to modern seismic design codes and which did not perform well.
                The majority of damaged structures had not been strengthened to increase earthquake
                resistance. Except for two deaths from landslides and one from fire, the remainder
                of the 62 deaths from the earthquake was due to partial or total collapse of older
                structures. The investigation provided the basis for recommendations to improve
                design and construction practices for buildings and lifeline structures and to
                mitigate damage to existing structures in future earthquakes.</abstract>
