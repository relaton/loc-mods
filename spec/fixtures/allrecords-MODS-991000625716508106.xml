      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">John Daugman correctly summarized the state of forensic iris
                recognition circa 2006 for the book Forensic Human Identification: an Introduction
                by Thompson (CRC Press, 2006). Iris recognition has limited forensic value, because
                (unlike fingerprints or DNA, for example) (1) iris patterns are not left behind at
                crime scenes; (2) and in death the pupil usually dilates significantly, the cornea
                clouds, and the iris tissue degrades relatively rapidly. (3) Moreover, currently
                available iris databases are quite small (only a few million digitized samples of
                iris patterns exist today); and because of the novelty of this biometric, (4) such
                data currently has no legal or established forensic status as admissible evidence.
                [Numbers () added.] In the intervening ?15 years, all of Daugman s observations,
                save one, have been overtaken by events: (1) The advent of ubiquitous high
                resolution video/photography has led to widespread
                collection/retention/dissemination of imagery of sufficient resolution for iris
                recognition. (2) Demonstrations of post-mortem iris recognition have been made. (3)
                Large iris databases have been constructed. The last issue (4) regarding admissible
                evidence remains to be resolved. Forensic iris was a topic at the June 2018 Iris
                Experts Group Meeting1. Key issues discussed there were: measurements and analysis
                that need to be done to provide the underpinnings for a resolution of the forensic
                status of iris recognition and the development of documentation for such
                measurements and analysis that will enable explanation of iris collection and
                recognition to lay audiences, including those in a courtroom. An important point was
                that the perceptions of the public and the popular media with respect to biometrics
                and to iris recognition in particular are frequently inaccurate and must be
                considered in any development of materials designed to explain iris recognition to
                the lay public. To help resolve the questions discussed at that meeting, this paper
                reviews the current state of the art in iris recognition, the perceptions of the
                public regarding iris recognition, and makes suggestions regarding measurements and
                analysis that will help enable use of forensic iris in appropriate settings going
                forward. We welcome comments for the next revision of this document. Please send
