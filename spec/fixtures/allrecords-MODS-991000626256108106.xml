      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In 2020, the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)
                Subcommittee on Advanced Manufacturing and Subcommittee on Machine Learning and
                Artificial Intelligence articulated cross-agency interest in the value and
                timeliness of organizing a symposium to outline benefits of AI adoption in
                manufacturing and identify issues that inhibit widescale adoption. In response, the
                National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) sponsored a three-workshop Symposium entitled Strategy for
                Resilient Manufacturing Ecosystems Through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to seek
                input from industry, academia, and government experts. The workshops focused on
                potential roles of each sector in performing research and development (R&amp;D) and
                ideas for implementation of AI in manufacturing that could inform the development of
                the U.S. Advanced Manufacturing strategic plan. This paper documents the Symposium
                recommendations with a roadmap organized to overcome the current lack of industry
                tools, trust, confidence, and experience with industry R&amp;D focused on the
                barriers to AI scaling and deployment. There are eight specific recommendations for
                collaborative actions by industry, government, and academia: 1. Establish new and/or
                expanded Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to facilitate a broad range of R&amp;D.
                2. Research, develop, and demonstrate advanced software tools, models, and
                infrastructure for AI/ML implementation and scale-up in manufacturing. 3. Establish
                programs that achieve industry collaboration on an integrated and trusted set of
                shared capabilities. 4. Initiate R&amp;D to enable industry-wide scaling and
                deployment of AI applications in manufacturing. 5. Educate and train a digital-savvy
                manufacturing workforce with software and hardware tools needed to deploy and scale
                the use of data and AI with trust and confidence. 6. Enable digital capabilities at
                small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs). 7. Incentivize AI adoption throughout
                established supply chains. 8. Promote new business models for AI adoption. As this
                adoption cycle takes hold, the market-driven forces of entrepreneurship and
                investment capital will ultimately lead to industry-wide adoption of AI technology,
                and the U.S. manufacturing industry will be on its way to achieving global
                leadership and resilient supply chains.</abstract>
