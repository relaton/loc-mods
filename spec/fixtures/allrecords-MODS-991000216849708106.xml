      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Cone calorimetric experiments of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF)
                and FPUF covered with a variety of fire-blocking barrier fabrics (BFs) were used to
                characterize and rank the effectiveness of BFs for reducing the flammability of
                residential upholstered furniture (RUF). In addition to BF properties, it was
                demonstrated that the burning behaviors of the FPUF/BF composites were sensitive to
                a wide range of experimental parameters including the sample configuration, heat
                losses to the underlying support base, and the two-stage pyrolysis behavior of the
                FPUF. Measurements using thermocouples (TCs) placed within the FPUF provided
                insights on FPUF pyrolysis behavior, the collapse rate of FPUF, and the thermal
                protective properties of barrier materials. Seven out of 16 FPUF/BF composites
                exhibited flame extinction during testing. Five out of the seven composites
                reignited when the spark ignition source was reapplied. Reignition allowed BF
                effectiveness to be assessed even for cases with flame extinction. Heat release rate
                (HRR) temporal profiles were measured for bare FPUF and the FPUF/BF composites. For
                cases where large rapid changes in HRR, e.g., during flash burning of a BF,
                occurred, it was necessary to correct the profiles for the finite time response of
                the cone calorimeter. The HRR curves for FPUF consisted of two distinct burning
                periods which were previously associated with sequential burning of foam pyrolyzates
                derived from the isocyanate and deposited liquid polyol components used in its
                manufacture. Tests with two different underlying substrates demonstrated the
                sensitivity of the second-stage liquid burning to heat losses from the sample
                holder. The majority of the HRR curves for the FPUF/BF composites showed evidence
                for three-stage burning, which was attributed to initial flash burning of the BF
                followed by the two-stage burning of the underlying FPUF. For most of the
                composites, the largest HRR peak, which is often used as the primary indicator for a
                material's flammability, occurred during the short-lived burning of the BF. Since
                this is not an appropriate measure of BF effectiveness, it is proposed here that
                effectiveness should be based on a BF's ability to reduce the HRR from the
                underlying FPUF. In general, the presence of a BF was shown to reduce the HRR peak
                values during both FPUF burning stages. The magnitude of the peak associated with
                second-stage FPUF burning (denoted PHRR2) was deemed the most appropriate for
                characterizing the thermal protection provided by a BF. Since the times for PHRR2
                also varied between composites, a measurement referred to as the peak fire growth
                rate (PFIGRA) parameter was calculated by dividing the PHRR by time since time to
                ignition was also considered for characterizing the BFs. Three possible
                classification schemes, each consisting of three classes, were introduced based on
                composite flame extinction and reignition behavior, PHRR2 values, and PFIGRA2
                values. Each scheme provided differentiation between BF effectiveness. While the
                schemes were able to assess whether the BFs were particularly effective or
                ineffective, there were variations among classes of BFs having intermediate levels
                of effectiveness. Further work will be required to assess which, if any, of the
                classification schemes are most appropriate for predicting BF performance in RUF. BF
                performance was shown to be associated with four properties that were previously
                identified as important BF properties: BF flammability, gas permeability, thermal
                protection, and physical integrity. In addition, the current experiments indicate
                the presence and effectiveness of gas-phase active flame retardants in the BF can
                also play an important role. A limited number of tests were conducted to de-couple
                the effects of flame-retardant chemicals and physical effects of BFs on FPUF burning
                behavior. These tests showed that while flameretardant chemicals can be effective in
                quenching and extinguishing the flames, the presence of effective BF shells is also
                very important in lowering the HRR of burning FPUF.</abstract>
