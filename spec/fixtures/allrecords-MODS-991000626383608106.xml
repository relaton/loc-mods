      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In 2019, COACh, an organization dedicated to developing equitable
                opportunities in science and engineering, contracted with NIST to design and
                implement a data-driven study to examine the causes of inequity in promotions and
                develop draft recommendations. This document compiles reports of that work. A
                companion report by Maya Noviski, NIST GCR 21-030 Supporting Women and
                Under-Represented Minorities in the Sciences: Implementing Equitable Approaches to
                organizational Change summarizes scholarly literature that informed final
                recommendations. The work began with listening sessions with NIST scientific staff
                and administrators (mainly ZPs and ZTs), which revealed that many employees held
                strong views about promotion opportunities and process. This was followed by
                analyses of NIST personnel actions from 2000 to 2019. (Reports in Part I.) In
                contrast to views often expressed in the listening sessions and implicit in the
                wording of the call for proposals, extensive statistical analyses found little
                evidence that women were disadvantaged in promotions or salaries. A survey of ZP
                employees supported these conclusions. (Reports in Part II.) However, extensive
                statistical analyses and examination of open-ended comments indicated less than half
                of the employees believed that the promotion criteria were understood by employees
                or appropriate for the NIST mission or their unit or that the promotion process was
                fair. The concerns were more often expressed by those at lower pay bands. Within
                bands, gender differences in views were minimal. Focus groups with ZP staff and
                Group Leaders, as well as interviews with ZT staff, confirmed the conclusions from
                the HR data and survey and provided examples of issues with the promotion criteria
                and process. Direct quotes informed our conclusions and expanded our recommendations
                for change. (Reports in part III.) The recommendations are designed to help develop
                a more transparent promotion process that is seen as fair and equitable by all staff
                (Part IV). Appendices include material for leaders implementing change or those
                interested in replicating the work.</abstract>
