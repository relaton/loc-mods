      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Manufacturers and manufacturing research organizations make
                investments to advance efficiency and competitiveness. Understanding the return for
                previously made investments can guide both manufacturers and researchers in
                identifying future investments with a high return. This paper examines trends in
                data from U.S. Department of Energy Industry Assessment Centers, which make
                technical assessments to reduce waste at small and medium sized manufacturers, to
                facilitate identifying potentially high return investments for manufacturers and
                researchers. The results show that the net present value is disproportionally
                distributed among investments, where 20 % of the investment categories represent 82
                % of the net present value (i.e., net benefits). For individual investments, 20 % of
                the cumulative investment cost accounts for 74 % of the net present value.
                Regression analysis identified those investments with a high return when controlling
                for a selection of factors. The results suggest that over time, the average Internal
                rate of return (IRR) decreases, larger firms tend to receive higher IRR, and some
                investment categories tend to have higher IRR than others. The highest IRR
                investments were related to bottleneck reduction, scheduling, and just-in-time
                inventory. The highest concentration of net present value was found in heat recovery
                with the second highest concentration being in cogeneration and the third highest in
                lighting. The most common high IRR investment type that was statistically
                significant in a regression analysis was related to heat recovery with the second
                relating to space conditioning and the third most common was related to
                cogeneration.</abstract>
