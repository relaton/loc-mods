      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV), which include “all-electric” battery
                EV (BEV) and plug-in hybrid EV (PHEV), comprise a rapidly growing proportion of the
                U.S. automobile market – nearly 8% of all light-duty vehicles sold in Oct. 2022, a
                41.4% rise over October 2021 sales. In response to projected demands for PEV
                charging, private companies, utilities, and state and local governments have strived
                to develop policies and infrastructure that promote broad access to electric vehicle
                supply equipment (EVSE) used to fuel electric vehicles. However, long-standing
                regulatory oversight of retail electricity distribution and sales through utilities
                has presented ambiguities and constraints regarding the sales of electricity for
                motor vehicle fueling, particularly via public charging stations. As these matters
                are addressed separately by the responsible authorities in each state, a patchwork
                of policies and rules has evolved across the U.S. concerning regulation of public
                EVSE sites and charging-related transactions. These policies, or lack thereof, have
                influenced permissible EVSE site ownership models, methods of sale and pricing for
                charging sessions, and requirements for metrological control of EVSE. Nonuniformity
                in EVSE operations across the U.S. can stimy expansion of interstate charging
                networks, hinder equity in the charging market, frustrate price comparison, and
                diminish consumer confidence. Thus, it is advantageous that many states in recent
                years have begun to adopt some consistent regulatory measures, including changes in
                most states to utility regulations to allow owners of EVSEs to make a profit from
                the sale of electrical energy used as a vehicle fuel. However, significant gaps and
                variation in oversight remain as charging networks expand. Considering these
                developments, this publication summarizes the current, albeit evolving, EVSE
                regulatory landscape in the U.S. and explores the increasingly relevant role of
                legal metrology in PEV charging. The implications of these topics and their relation
                to other currently evolving issues, including submetering for utility PEV time of
                use rates and for PEV fuel excise taxes, are also discussed.</abstract>
