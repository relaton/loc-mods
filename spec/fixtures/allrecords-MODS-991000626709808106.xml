      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network
                (NPSBN), the publicsafety community is in the process of supplementing the use of
                land mobile radios with atechnology ecosystem that will include a variety of new and
                improved communication tools, including a range of broadband data sharing platforms.
                As these technologies are beingdeveloped, researchers and industry alike need to
                focus on the end users – the firstresponders – in order to ensure successful and
                usable systems. Understanding the userpopulation of first respondersis key to
                improved usability. The National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST) Public
                Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Usability Team took amulti-phase, mixed
                methods approach in order to provide greater understanding of publicsafety
                technology users, their experiences, and their technology needs and problems.This
                report, Phase 1, Volume 5, is the 5th in a series of reports on the data from the
                Phase 1in-depth interviews. This report is a companion document and should be used
                in conjunctionwith the Phase 1, Volume 2 report that identifies the technology
                problems and needs of firstresponders from the in-depth interview data. The current
                report focuses on providingpractical guidance and recommendations for improving the
                usability of communicationtechnology for first responders by applying human factors
                and ergonomics (HFE) principlesand usability evaluation methodology. The field of
                HFE considers five major aspects (perceptual, cognitive, physical, environmental,
                and social &amp; organizational) of humaninteractions with systems to optimize human
                well-being and overall system performance.In Phase 1 in-depth interviews, 193 first
                responders–from Comm Center &amp; 9-1-1 Services (COMMS), Emergency Medical Services
                (EMS), Fire Service (FF), and Law Enforcement (LE) –have been interviewed. A total
                of 107 categories of technology problems and needs wereidentified as documented in
                the Phase 1, Volume 2 report. In this report, from the usabilityand HFE
                perspectives, we performed further assessment on those 107 categories and
                dividedthem into two main groups. In the first group, 27 categories were clustered
                into 14 topics.For each of the 14 topics, specific HFE recommendations were made in
                order to ensure theusability of communication technology for first responders. In
                the other group, the remaining80 categories of technology problems and needs were
                clustered into 6 topicsin which genericHFE considerations are applicable.To ensure
                the usability of communication technology for first responders, both groupsrequire a
                two-stage human-centered process to be followed for technology development
                andimplementation. The two-stage (requirement analysis and usability testing)
                process includes:(1) HFE professional(s) is integrated with the product team from
                the initiation and throughoutthe product development lifecycle; (2) at various
                stages, the product needs to go throughusability evaluations before the final
                implementation. The HFE professional must approvethat the product and technology
                meet the HFE and usability requirements to be ready forfinal implementation.The
                objective of this report is to provide concise and actionable HFE guidance
                andrecommendations to the PSCR R&amp;D community without extensive discussions on
                thetheoretical background information. Practitioners interested in addressing a
                specific topic caniiThis publication is available free of charge from:
