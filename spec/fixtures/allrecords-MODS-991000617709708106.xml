      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Executive Order (EO) 13717: Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk
                Management Standard establishes minimum seismic requirements for new and existing
                buildings that will be constructed, altered, leased, financed, or regulated by the
                Federal Government. These requirements help to enhance the seismic resilience of
                agencies by reducing risk to lives of building occupants and improving the
                probability of continued performance of buildings essential to agency mission
                following future earthquakes. The EO rescinds EO 12941: Seismic Safety of Existing
                Federally Owned or Leased Buildings and EO 12699: Seismic Safety of Federal and
                Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction. The EO requires that
                agencies whose activities are covered by the order submit a biennial report to the
                Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the
                National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on their progress in
                implementing the order, commencing two years from the date of the order. It is
                assumed that agencies that are covered by the EO participate on the Interagency
                Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC). NIST, as the lead agency of the
                National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and thus Secretariat of the
                ICSSC, is required by the EO to summarize agency compliance of the order in the
                biennial NEHRP report to Congress. This report serves as the summary of agency
                progress in implementing the EO and covers the biennial reporting period of February
                2, 2020 to February 1, 2022. Sixteen reports covering sixty-six agencies
                (department, agency, bureau, office, institute, etc.) were received by NIST for this
                reporting period.</abstract>
