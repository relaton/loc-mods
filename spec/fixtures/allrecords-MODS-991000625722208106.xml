      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The Engineering Laboratory (EL) of the National Institute of
                Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a variety of tools that provide some
                level of economic analysis, many of which have been developed by EL s Applied
                Economics Office (AEO). AEO-developed tools range across topic areas and economic
                metrics. Each tool is targeting government agencies and organizations that fall
                under NIST s mission. Stakeholders need different levels of details and
                functionality because of the diverse backgrounds across stakeholders. As a result,
                AEO has developed these software tools in a one-off approach on an as needed basis.
                As a result, each software has its own unique set of code even though these tools
                have some key underlying components that are common across tools, including
                methodology documented in standards. To improve the efficiency of the tools
                developed by AEO and its stakeholders, AEO has developed an economic service/engine
                with an associated Application Programming Interface (API) that provides consistent,
                standardized, transparent, reproducible economic analysis calculations should be
                developed, maintained, and made publicly available for internal and external
                researchers, analysts, and software developers called the Economic Evaluation Engine
                (E3). E3 provides economic evaluation capabilities based on ASTM building economic
                standards including life-cycle cost analysis, benefit-cost analysis, profit
                maximization / cost-minimization, and risk-cost analysis. E3 could be leveraged by
                NIST as well as other federal agencies and national laboratories, state and local
                governments, academia, and the private sector to improve their tool development by
                using a federally developed and validated calculations to provide
                standard-consistent analysis. E3 is publicly accessible on a NIST server as well as
                on GitHub for anyone to use for economic analysis, whether it s through a basic
                script calling on the E3 API, online interface that connects to the E3 API, or an
                executable program that is built on E3 s capabilities. Additionally, users of E3
                could provide expansions to the capabilities by developing the code and submitting
                it to NIST for review and incorporation. This technical manual describes E3,
                including the underlying standards on which its based, the data flow through the
                tool, details on the code libraries, classes, and file structure, development tools
                used, guidance on how to use the tool, limitations, planned release, and the
                development of its future capabilities.</abstract>
