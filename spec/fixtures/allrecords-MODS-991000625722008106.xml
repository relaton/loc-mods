      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report documents an experimental program designed to investigate
                High Energy Arcing Fault (HEAF) phenomena for low-voltage metal enclosed switchgear
                containing aluminum conductors. This report covers full-scale laboratory experiments
                using representative nuclear power plant (NPP) three-phase electrical equipment.
                Electrical, thermal, and pressure data were recorded for each experiment and
                documented in this report. This report covers experiments performed on two
                low-voltage switchgear units with each unit consisting of two vertical sections. The
                data collected supports characterization of the low-voltage HEAF hazard, and these
                results will be used to support potential improvements in fire probabilistic risk
                assessment (PRA) methods. The experiments were performed at KEMA Labs located in
                Chalfont, Pennsylvania. The experimental design, setup, and execution were completed
                by staff from the NRC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
                Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and KEMA. In addition, representatives from the
                Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) observed some of the experimental setup and
                execution. The HEAF experiments were performed between August 26 and August 29, 2019
                on near-identical Westinghouse Type DS low-voltage metal-enclosed indoor switchgear.
                The three-phase arcing fault was initiated on the aluminum main bus or in select
                cases on the copper bus stabs near the breaker. These experiments used either
                nominal 480 V (AC) or 600 V (AC). Durations of the experiments ranged from
                approximately 0.4 s to 8.3 s with fault currents ranging from approximately 9.2 kA
                to 19.3 kA. Real-time electrical operating conditions, including voltage, current,
                and frequency, were measured during the experiments. Heat fluxes and incident
                energies were measured with plate thermometers, radiometers, and slug calorimeters
                at various locations around the electrical enclosures. Environmental measurements of
                breakdown, conductivity, and electromagnetics were also taken. The experiments were
                documented with normal and high-speed videography, infrared imaging, and
                photography. The results, while limited, indicated the difficulty in maintaining and
                sustaining low-voltage arcs on aluminum components of sufficient duration and at a
                single point as observed from operating experience.</abstract>
