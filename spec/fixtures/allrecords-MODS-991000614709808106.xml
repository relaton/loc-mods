      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in computational mechanics and
                earthquake engineering. Sensitivity analysis of a model (either numerical or
                physical) aims at quantifying the relative importance of each input parameter, their
                potential interaction, and their effects on the model response. Sensitivity analysis
                has a long-term application in structural engineering more specifically on
                reinforced concrete RC structures. Many researchers benefited from the results of
                sensitivity analysis to reduce the uncertainty domain to those variables which are
                very important. This further helps in uncertainty quantification by accelerating the
                entire process. This state-of-the-art technical report provides a comprehensive
                review of classical sensitivity analysis techniques, followed by an in-depth review
                of all the related documents that implemented a full sensitivity analysis or
                partially adopted it for uncertainty quantification-related discussions. This review
                report on sensitivity analysis of reinforced concrete structures is a valuable
                contribution to the field of computational mechanics and earthquake engineering.
                This review highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate sensitivity
                analysis technique to achieve reliable results in structural analysis and design. By
                providing insights into the advantages and limitations of various sensitivity
                analysis techniques, this report can guide researchers, practitioners, and
                decision-makers in selecting the most appropriate technique for their specific
                applications. It is observed that the outcome of a sensitivity analysis depends
                heavily on the applied technique to perform the sensitivity assessment which
                eventually may cause a significant bias during the decision making. This report
                paves the road for better selection of a sensitivity analysis technique in problems
                related to structural and earthquake engineering. The findings of this review have
                significant implications for improving the accuracy and reliability of structural
                analysis, ultimately leading to safer and more resilient structures.</abstract>
