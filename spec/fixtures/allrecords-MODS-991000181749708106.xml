      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">A series of experiments was conducted to examine fire spread along
                fences subjected to wind at various speeds and angles. Specifically, sections of
                western redcedar, California redwood, or vinyl privacy fences were ignited with a
                burner. Wind fields of 9 m/s, 13.5 m/s, or 18 m/s aligned with, perpendicular to, or
                at a 45 angle to the fences were applied during the experiments. To simulate fine
                fuels typically present in real installations, dried shredded hardwood mulch beds
                were placed under most of the fence sections. Also, some fence sections were coated
                with fence preservative to assess its effect on fire spread. Pans of mulch were
                downwind targets for firebrands produced by the burning fence and mulch bed. At all
                wind speeds tested, a mulch bed was required for flames to spread. Fastest flame
                spread was achieved with the fence aligned with the wind field. During most
                experiments, the burning mulch and fences produced firebrands which ignited spot
                fires in the mulch targets. These experiments demonstrated that ignited wood fence
                structures can be rapid conduits for fire along them and potentially spread fire to
                attached or adjacent structures. Additionally, it was found that burning fences can
                produce spot fires from their own firebrand generation. This study of fence fire
                spread is part of a series designed to better inform standards and codes regarding
                placement of landscape features around homes at risk of exposure to wildland-urban
                interface fires.</abstract>
