      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Global production and consumption of plastics and its deposition in
                the environment are growing rapidly, while their life-cycle impacts to the
                environment are yet to be fully understood. This study reviews the existing
                literature with the goal of evaluating the state of current data and knowledge on
                plastics life-cycle environmental impacts. We identified 98 peer-reviewed journal
                papers, 25 reports, 8 databases as well as 21 existing reviews on the environmental
                impacts of plastics. Our review shows that life-cycle approaches have been
                instrumental in gaining new insights on the environmental implications of plastics.
                Global life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from plastics, for example, is
                estimated to be around 1.7 Gt CO2 e yr -1 , which is substantially larger than the
                GHG emissions from global aviation. LCAs have also been widely employed in various
                comparative studies such as biomass v.s. petroleum-based plastics, single-use
                plastics v.s. multi-use alternatives, which often result in counterintuitive
                outcomes. However, our analysis also indicates that there still is a paucity of
                reliable data and tools for conducting LCAs of plastics. In particular, we find that
                Asia, the major plastic-producing region, is scarcely covered by existing literature
                and databases. In addition, the life-cycle impacts of plastic additives, and the
                degradation pathways and associated environmental, human and ecological impacts of
                plastics are poorly understood, limiting our ability to gauge the life-cycle impacts
                of plastics. Furthermore, we find that a consensus on the allocation of
                environmental impacts for the recycling and reuse of plastics is yet to be reached.
                We identify four major areas of future research including: (1) developing the method
                for reliable estimate of the amount of plastics entering the environment, (2)
                understanding plastics environmental degradation pathways, degradation byproducts,
                and their human and ecological impacts, (3) expanding the coverage of life-cycle
                inventory data across geographies and additives, and (4) building consensus on key
                methodological issues including those around allocation.</abstract>
