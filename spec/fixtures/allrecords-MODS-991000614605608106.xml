      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Buildings as a set of electric loads and generation resources can
                play an essential role in managing the stability of the power system in a smart
                grid. Traditionally, buildings assumed a passive rule in the day-to-day operation of
                the electric grid. Utilities control the supply of energy to match the demand for
                buildings. However, the dynamics of the power distribution grid are rapidly
                changing. A critical aspect of managing the balance between supply and demand in the
                distribution grid is estimating future demand through load forecasting. Loading
                forecasting requires accurate, adaptive, and simple models to account for the
                dynamic behavior of the electrical demand. In residential buildings, heat pumps are
                a significant source of energy consumption. This document describes a novel gray-box
                model (RL Model) to forecast a two-stage air-source heat pump's steady-state and
                transient current consumption in heating and cooling seasons. The RL Model is based
                on the solution of a first-order differential equation describing the
                characteristics of a resistor-inductor equivalent circuit and the steady-state power
                consumption of a heat pump. The steady-state power consumption of the heat pump is a
                strong function of the outdoor temperature. Key parameters of the RL Model were
                estimated using a learning algorithm. The performance of the RL Model is validated
                using measurement data from the Net-Zero Energy Residential Test Facility located on
                the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) campus in Gaithersburg,
                MD. The predicted output of the RL Model, current consumption, is used to estimate
                the heat pump's real and reactive power consumption for different operating stages
                and seasons. A list of key parameters, like the time constant and
                temperature-dependent coefficients of the RL Model, are tabulated. Knowledge of the
                time constant provides critical information for analyzing the aggregated effect of
                controlling many heat pumps, as flexible loads, on grid stability and provision of
                ancillary services. The average root mean squared error between the RL Model's
                predicted current output and the measured current consumption is 0.06.</abstract>
