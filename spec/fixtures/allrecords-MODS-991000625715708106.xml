      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">On February 2, 2016, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO)
                13717: Establishing a Federal Earthquake Risk Management Standard. The EO
                establishes a minimum level of seismic safety compliance for new and existing
                buildings that will be constructed, altered, leased, financed, or regulated by the
                Federal Government. The primary purpose of this standard is to enhance the seismic
                resilience of agencies by reducing risk to lives of building occupants and improving
                the probability of continued performance of buildings essential to agency operations
                and functions following future earthquakes. The EO requires that agencies whose
                activities are covered by the order submit a biennial report to the Director of the
                Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Director of the National Institute of
                Standards and Technology (NIST) on their progress in implementing the order,
                commencing two years from the date of the order. NIST, as the lead agency of the
                National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), is required by the EO to
                summarize agency compliance of the order in the biennial NEHRP report to Congress.
                This report serves as the first summary of agency efforts to comply with the EO.
                Because of legislative reporting changes in the NEHRP Reauthorization Act of 2018
                (Public Law 115-307), this report is made available as an independent interim report
                until such time that it can be integrated into the official biennial NEHRP report to
                Congress.</abstract>
