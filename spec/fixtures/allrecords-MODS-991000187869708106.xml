      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Many homeowners and government programs are using insulating
                products, such as SPF, at a growing rateto increase the energy efficiency of their
                residences and other constructed buildings. Retrofitting or addition of foam
                insulation in new construction is also supported in the United States by Federal
                efforts, such as tax incentives, and programs like Environmental Protection Agency
                (EPA) Energy Star and Design for the Environment. Because of these programs and
                other drivers for more efficient buildings, the insulation foam industry expects
                significant growth in the use of their products over the next few years. , SPF is
                used as both an insulation and a sealant. It is formed onsite via an exothermic
                chemical reaction between A-side and B-side chemicals and. The A-side typically
                consists of monomeric or polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. Polyols are part
                of the B-side chemicals, which also include amine and/or metal catalysts, blowing
                agents, surfactants, and flame retardants. Amine and/or metal catalysts are used to
                promote the reaction between polyols and A-side chemicals, which help polyurethane
                foam cells develop sufficient strength to maintain their structure and resist
                collapsing. CPSC, along with EPA and other federal agencies, has received a number
                of complaints regarding health effects resulting from the installation of SPF in
                homes. Residents have complained about a multitude of adverse effects including
                severe respiratory irritation, breathing difficulties, dizziness and nausea. In some
                cases, the reported effects are so severe that consumers report that they can no
                longer live in their homes. These health effects are reported to occur several days
                to months following the SPF installation in the home.</abstract>
