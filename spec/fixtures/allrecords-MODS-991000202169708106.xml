      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Several international standards and regulations regarding residential
                cooktop ignition prevention have existed for as long as a decade. A series of
                cooking experiments were conducted by National Institute of Standards and Technology
                (NIST) to examine the effectiveness of the cooktop ignition prevention technologies.
                Several types of commercially available full-scale residential cooktops with
                integrated ignition prevention technologies were tested. The experiments provided
                data on the character of the ignition prevention technologies and their performance
                in terms of ignition prevention of oil-based cooking fires. About 80 experiments
                were conducted using both gas and electric cooktops, including four propane gas
                powered cooktops sold in Asia and one stove with electric coil heating elements sold
                in the USA. One retrofit ignition prevention system for electric coil heating
                elements was also tested. The ignition prevention technologies used a variety of
                configurations and engineering designs. Experiments were conducted using four types
                of cooking vessels. The pans tested were approximately round, about 20 cm to 22 cm
                in diameter, and 4 cm to 5 cm in depth. The tests followed the UL 858 standard on
                abnormal cooktop fire hazards. Five thermocouples were attached on the bottom of the
                pans in a cross pattern and the average pan temperature during cooking was
                monitored. For the experiments involving cooking oil, the incidence of auto-ignition
                was observed. About half of the experiments were conducted using dry pans and about
                half were conducted on pans that held small amounts of Canola oil. The results
                showed that some of the cooktop technologies were more reliable than others in
                preventing oil ignition and maintaining temperatures below the UL 858 standard's
                limit temperature criteria. And the results confirm that residential cooktop
                ignition prevention technologies can be effective for both electric and gas
                cooktops.</abstract>
