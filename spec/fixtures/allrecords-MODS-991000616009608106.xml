      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Impacts of wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires continue to rise in
                the U.S., as evidenced by the string of devastating and record-breaking events
                occurring since 2017. As seen in several events in recent years, WUI fires can
                impact communities quickly, leaving little to no time for civilians to evacuate.
                Numerous events have also occurred internationally, including Australia, Canada,
                Chile, Greece, and Portugal. One example is the Camp Fire that occurred on November
                8, 2018, in Butte County, CA. The fire resulted in 85 fatalities and the destruction
                and damage of over 18 000 buildings, destroying over 90 % of the buildings in the
                town of Paradise. Following the fire, NIST initiated a case study to document and
                analyze fire spread and behavior, notifications, evacuations, and defensive actions
                to support preparedness for future WUI fires. The NIST Camp Fire case study has
                highlighted a number of potential challenges that intermix communities may face
                during WUI fire events. The purpose of this report is to use the lessons learned
                from the NIST Camp Fire case study to present a methodology and other considerations
                about WUI fire incidents that can be used by small and intermediate-sized WUI
                communities to help develop notification and evacuation plans. The proposed
                methodology considers the spatial and temporal components of fire spread and the
                resulting impacts of fire on evacuation to develop an evacuation triangle that can
                be used as the foundation for notification and evacuation decisions by emergency
                managers. This report provides communities a path forward for assessing, planning,
                and implementing a notification/evacuation plan that leverages pre-fire conditions,
                local knowledge, and during event information to enhance the life safety of
                civilians and first responders. While additional research will provide further
                refinements, specifically in the areas of weather forecasting, fire spread modeling,
                and evacuation modeling, the proposed system outlines a path for community leaders
                to effectively work with first responders before a fire to assess and prepare the
                community for WUI fire events that can strike with little or no notice. The
                methodology provides community leaders with a temporal context of WUI fire events
                that will enable them to better evaluate different hazard reduction and risk
                management strategies to enhance the life safety of residents and first
                responders.</abstract>
