      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Research was conducted on the performance of currently available
                smoke alarms to the new fire and cooking nuisance source tests specified in ANSI/UL
                217-2015, Standard for Safety of Smoke Alarms. The standard calls for additional
                room-scale fire tests with smoldering and flaming polyurethane foam and a broiling
                hamburgers cooking test. The objectives of this research was to assess whether the
                new performance tests will foster a demonstrable enhancement in smoke alarm
                performance compared to a wide range of currently available smoke alarms and whether
                the single nuisance source test is representative of a range of cooking nuisance
                scenarios. There were 45 distinct smoke alarm models from seven different
                manufacturers used in the study. There were 14 ionization sensor models, 14
                photoelectric sensor models, seven combination photoelectric and carbon monoxide
                sensor models, four combination ionization and carbon monoxide sensor models, four
                combination ionization and photoelectric sensor models, and two combination
                photoelectric and thermal sensor models. Six units of each model were used in the
                experiments for a total of 270 individual smoke alarms used in the study. The
                sensitivity of each alarm was measured in a smoke box with cotton wick smoke per the
                ANSI/UL 217-2012. The measured sensitivities across the different models covered
                nearly the entire range of allowed sensitivities. Analysis of these results showed
                that no current smoke alarm model would likely meet the new test performance levels
                required in the ANSI/UL 217-2015. Three models, all photoelectric sensor alarms,
                came closest to meeting the requirements. It was concluded that an across the board
                increase to the level of performance specified in ANSI-UL 217-2015 would
                significantly improve the overall performance of smoke alarms by expanding the range
                of fire scenarios alarms must respond to while requiring resistance to nuisance
                alarms. The changes introduced in ANSI/UL 217-2015, which include the new
                performance fire tests and the new nuisance resistance test, may represent
                significant challenges for manufacturers to meet the requirements by simply using
                both photoelectric and ionization sensors, or designing alarms that perform as well
                against the new fire tests as combination ionization / photoelectric models
                examined. The aerosol generation rate between the cooking nuisance sources varied
                significantly as did the relationship between the light obscuration and measuring
                ionization chamber values. Toasting bread produced essentially no measurable
                obscuration, thus alarms with only photoelectric, carbon monoxide, and thermal
                sensors typically did not alarm during those experiments. However, ionization alarms
                did respond to toasting bread aerosols at about the same measuring ionization
                chamber level as the broiling hamburgers experiments. As a nuisance test, the
                broiling hamburgers test challenged the majority of smoke alarms included in this
                study, and therefore may be considered a conservative test. Ultimately, cooking
                nuisance experiments on a range of smoke alarms that ANSI/UL 217-2015 will confirm
                the appropriateness of the broiling hamburgers cooking nuisance scenario as the
                model test.</abstract>
