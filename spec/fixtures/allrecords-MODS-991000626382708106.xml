      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">A series of measurements was conducted to characterize the structure
                of a 1 m diameter methanol pool fire steadily burning with a constant lip height in
                a well-ventilated quiescent environment. Time-averaged local measurements of
                gas-phase temperature were conducted using 50 ?m diameter, Type S, bare wire,
                thermocouples with a bead that was approximately spherical with a diameter of about
                150 ?m. The thermocouple bead temperature was corrected for radiative loss and
                thermal inertia effects. The contribution of the radiative loss correction and
                thermal inertia correction terms to uncertainty of the gas velocity was analyzed. A
                simulation of the 1 m methanol pool fire was conducted using the Fire Dynamics
                Simulator (FDS) to obtain the gas velocity distribution above the burner which
                helped correct the thermocouple temperature measurement to obtain the gas
                temperature. The gas temperature distribution profile above the burner centerline
                was compared to previous studies of a 30 cm methanol fire. The maximum mean gas
                temperature was 1371 K, which occurred 30 cm above the burner on the centerline.
                Careful analysis determined that the average combined uncertainty of the mean and
                the standard deviation of the measured gas temperature was 5 % and 26 %,
                respectively. The actual heat release rate was measured using oxygen consumption
                calorimetry and compared favorably with the ideal heat release rate calculated from
                the measured mass burning rate. The heat flux distribution about the pool fire was
                measured using fourteen wide-angle view, water-cooled, Gardon-type, total heat flux
                gauges. The radiative emission from the fire was estimated by considering the
                radiative heat flux through a virtual cylinder about the fire and by a single point
                estimate. The radiative emission measurements coupled with the mass loss measurement
                allowed determination of the radiative fraction, which was equal to 0.22 16 % and
                0.20 34 % for the multi-location and single-location measurements, respectively.
                Flame characteristics, such as, the mean flame height, pulsation frequency and the
                flame instability near the fuel surface, were analyzed using the 30 Hz video record
                of the fire. The mean flame height was measured as 1.10 m 0.22 m above the burner
                rim and the puffing frequency was about 1.37 Hz, which was consistent with a Fourier
                analysis of the transient thermocouple measurements (=1.39 Hz 0.013 Hz). The pool
                surface temperature was measured to be nearly the fuel boiling point.</abstract>
