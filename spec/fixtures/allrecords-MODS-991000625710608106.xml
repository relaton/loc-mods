      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report documents the design and construction of a reduced-scale
                compartment and summary data for a set of gaseous fuel experiments to study the
                backdraft phenomenon. In these experiments, a fire was enclosed in a compartment
                with modified configurations (e.g., fire size, fuel-off time, spark ignition
                location, spark delay time, and front opening) to identify precursors to a backdraft
                event. A moderate fire size of 25 kW was studied using methane, propane, and propene
                as individual fuels. A 16.7 kW propane fire and 37.5 kW methane fire were also
                studied. Temperature readings in the upper and lower layers of the compartment,
                pressure, external heat flux measurements, and heat flux measurements at the
                compartment floor were recorded during each experiment. For experiments where a
                backdraft occurred, flame size measurements and ignition times relative to the
                doorway opening were obtained from video recordings during the experiments.
                Experiments were repeated at least once for each set of selected experimental
                conditions. Fuel flow conditions for each fuel and fire size produced events ranging
                from no ignition to backdrafts for the range of compartment configurations studied.
                In general, the transition from no ignition to increasingly larger backdrafts was
                observed for each fuel as its flow time was increased.</abstract>
