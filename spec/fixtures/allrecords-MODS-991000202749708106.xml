      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report documents twenty-one structures that were ignited or
                significantly damaged by burning wildland vegetation in Virginia over a two-year
                period starting in 2015. The structures included all of those that would have been
                lost except for the intervention of local fire departments or the Virginia
                Department of Forestry to suppress the fires. The objective of the study was to
                supply data to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from
                wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire sites where structures were ignited, including
                incident date, structure location, type of wildland vegetation that spread fire to
                the structure, and the first material ignited. Most of the incidents involved
                storage or utility buildings that were typically located away from residences where
                landscaped ground cover abutted a forested area on private property. Many of the
                structures ignited had wood or wood based exterior finish materials. Exterior
                finishes were burned and, in many cases burned through allowing fire to spread to
                the interior. In most cases, the fire was spread to the structure through leaves on
                the ground. In those incidents, ground leaf and tree litter cover sufficient to
                spread fire and ignite the structures was estimated to be between 8 cm and 13 cm (3
                in and 5 in) deep. Video from the 2016 Chalet Village WUI community fire (near
                Gatlinburg, Tennessee) showed that the same ignition mechanism played a role in the
                ignition of structures in that community.</abstract>
