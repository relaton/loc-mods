      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Building stakeholders need practical metrics, data, and tools to
                support decisions related to sustainable building designs, technologies, standards,
                and codes. The Engineering Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) has addressed this high priority national need by extending its
                metrics and tools for sustainable building products, known as Building for
                Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES), to whole-buildings. A
                sustainability measurement system has been developed consisting of whole-building
                sustainability metrics that are based on innovative extensions to life-cycle
                assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches involving whole-building
                energy simulations. The measurement system evaluates the sustainability of both the
                materials and the energy used by a building over time. It assesses the carbon
                footprint of buildings as well as 11 other environmental performance metrics, and
                integrates economic performance metrics to yield science-based measures of the
                business case for investment choices in high-performance green buildings. Building
                Industry Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS) applies the sustainability
                measurement system to an extensive whole-building performance database NIST has
                compiled for this purpose. Based on the NIST Net-Zero Energy Residential Test
                Facility (NZERTF), the BIRDS Low-Energy Residential Incremental Energy Efficiency
                Improvements Database includes energy, environmental, and cost measurements for 960
                000 design variations of the NZERTF for Gaithersburg, MD for study periods up to 30
                years. Focusing on a single location allows for the consideration of incremental
                building energy efficiency measures, both those specified in the most recent
                International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and those implemented in the NZERTF.
                Buildings designed to meet current energy codes can be compared to alternative
                building designs to determine the impacts of improving building energy efficiency on
                overall sustainability performance. This report describes the latest version of
                BIRDS (v4.1) including new options, namely natural gas-fired space and water heater
                equipment.</abstract>
