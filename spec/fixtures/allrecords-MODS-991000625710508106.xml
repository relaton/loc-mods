      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Cloud-native applications have evolved into a standardized
                architecture consisting of multiple loosely coupled components called microservices
                (often typically implemented as containers) that are supported by an infrastructure
                for providing application services, such as service mesh. Both of these components
                are usually hosted on a container orchestration and resource management platform. In
                this architecture, the entire set of source code involved in the application
                environment can be divided into five code types: 1) application code (which embodies
                the application logic), 2) application services code (for services such as session
                establishment, network connection, etc.), 3) infrastructure as code (for
                provisioning and configuring computing, networking, and storage resources), 4)
                policy as code (for defining runtime policies such as zero trust expressed as a
                declarative code), 5) and observability as code (for the continuous monitoring of an
                application runtime state). Due to security, business competitiveness, and the
                inherent structure of loosely coupled application components, this class of
                applications needs a different development, deployment, and runtime paradigm.
                DevSecOps (consisting of acronyms for Development, Security, and Operations,
                respectively) has been found to be a facilitating paradigm for these applications
                with primitives such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous
                deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines are workflows for taking the developer
                s source code through various stages, such as building, testing, packaging,
                deployment, and operations supported by automated tools with feedback mechanisms.
                The objective of this document is to provide guidance for the implementation of
                DevSecOps primitives for cloud-native applications with the architecture and code
                types described above. The benefits of this approach for high security assurance and
                for enabling continuous authority to operate (C-ATO) are also discussed.</abstract>
