      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Fire resistance of timber structures is a very large field. In order
                to keep this document relatively small, the scope of is limited as follows: This
                report attempts to define a Performance-Based framework for the fire safety design
                of multi-story timber buildings. The report concentrates on medium-rise multi-story
                timber buildings from 3 stories to 10 stories tall, which are likely to be most
                popular and technical feasible. Taller buildings are discussed briefly. The report
                concentrates on mass timber buildings, constructed from large timber posts and beams
                (from LVL or glulam) and large wood panel construction using cross-laminated timber
                (CLT) or other heavy timber panels. Light wood frame buildings protected with gypsum
                plasterboard (2 by 4 construction) have been covered elsewhere and are not
                considered to be feasible for building above about 6 stories. The report
                concentrates on the fire resistance of structural elements and assemblies, and does
                not include early fire safety issues such as ignition and flame-spread on wood
                surfaces. It does not address broader fire safety issues such as fire safety
                systems, fire fighting, or evacuation. External fire spread via building facades and
                windows is partly included, since wooden fa ade claddings are considered by many
                architects to be an essential feature of timber buildings, at least up to 8-10
                stories. Automatic fire sprinkler systems are discussed briefly, since the
                combination of active and passive fire protection is considered to be an important
                way to provide fire safety for tall timber buildings. Fire resistance of timber
                connections is included briefly, including both mechanical fasteners and glued
                connections. The influence of adhesives on the fire behaviour of bonded structural
                timber elements is discussed briefly.</abstract>
