      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Exhaust flow measurements have been found to be a significant source
                of uncertainty for measurements of heat release rate in large-scale fire
                experiments. Asymmetric or skewed velocity distributions are often present in the
                exhaust ducts for open calorimetry systems used in large-fire research facilities,
                therefore making it difficult to measure exhaust flow accurately. Tracer gas
                dilution is a standard test method for determining volume flow in ducts. It is not
                sensitive to flow distribution and is derived from measurements independent of most
                flow monitoring techniques. Therefore, it is well suited for in-line calibrations of
                flow measurement devices in the exhaust ducts of facilities conducting large-scale
                fire experiments. For the first time, the method has been applied to calibrate the
                routine exhaust flow measurements at the National Fire Research Laboratory as a
                means to reduce the measurement uncertainty associated with open calorimetry
                systems. Measurement uncertainty for the calibration is estimated at 3 % and
                accounts for potential error due to incomplete mixing of the tracer. Multi-port
                sampling of the tracer, which is not part of the existing standard test method, is
                also demonstrated as a means to reduce the potential for measurement error due to
                incomplete mixing. Exhaust velocity and mass flow are necessary to compute heat
                release rate, and both are determined by averaging pitot probes installed in the
                exhaust ducts. An in-line calibration of the averaging pitot probes was conducted
                using tracer gas dilution. Measurement uncertainty for calibrated exhaust velocity
                and calibrated mass flow is estimated at 3 %. The in-line calibration of the exhaust
                flow measurement is an improvement over the accepted practice of comparing oxygen
                consumption calorimetry with heat release rate measured at a gas burner to develop a
                correction for the flow measurement. It is valid for a wide range of flow conditions
                and decouples measurement error between oxygen consumption calorimetry and fuel
                consumption calorimetry; therefore improving overall measurement accuracy for heat
                release rate.</abstract>
