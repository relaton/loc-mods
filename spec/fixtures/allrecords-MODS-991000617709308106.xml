      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Reference buildings have been defined previously and successfully
                applied to energy and indoor air quality analyses, providing a platform for
                consistent comparisons between different building design and operation scenarios.
                One such set of reference buildings, the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology’s (NIST) suite of homes, is a collection of dwellings developed to
                represent 80 % of the U.S. housing stock at the time of their development [1]. A
                second set is the Department of Energy’s commercial prototype building models, which
                is a collection of buildings developed to represent U.S. commercial and
                institutional buildings [2]. These building models allow for the assessment of new
                technologies and the resulting impacts on building energy efficiency, ventilation,
                and indoor air quality. In addition to the aforementioned aspects of building
                performance, water quality and efficiency are also of current interest [3]. A
                building’s premise plumbing system plays a critical role in managing water quality
                and efficiency by bringing in clean, potable water and removing wastewater and can
                impact health and safety of building occupants. Using models to evaluate the
                performance of premise plumbing systems can be useful but most studies have
                considered different buildings with different plumbing systems. In order to support
                more consistent modeling efforts, NIST has developed premise plumbing system models
                for three residential buildings and four commercial buildings and has made them
                available for researchers and industry to analyze system performance, new
                technologies, and design &amp; operation strategies. This report describes the seven
                plumbing system designs, how they were developed and how they can be
                accessed.</abstract>
