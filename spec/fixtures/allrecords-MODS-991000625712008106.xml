      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Casualties in fires--and in particular, deaths--are tail events. The
                average fire does not cause deaths or injuries. There is increasing evidence that
                the people susceptible to dying in fires are a specific subset of the people in
                homes. It seems likely that the same holds true of the fire and the environment as
                well. That is, that it is a suite of circumstances that produce deaths (and to a
                lesser extent injuries) in fires. While there has been a lot of valuable work aimed
                at identifying characteristics associated with deaths in fire, there has been little
                aimed at identifying those suites of conditions that produce fire deaths. One that
                can be readily identified is a cigarette fire ignited on or in the immediate
                vicinity of a person who is frail. Other suites of circumstances are less clear.
                There are a number of observations that can be made based on the research regarding
                fire in domestic environments. The large majority of fires are not reported to the
                fire department, and evidence suggests that the majority of those fires are put out
                by the people on site. This occurs in spite of the frequent admonition to Get out,
                Stay out.... \cite{thompson_2015}. It is a reminder that people do not necessarily
                always act in accordance with fire-safety messaging. The typical engineering
                approach to fire design--ASET/RSET--does not explicitly capture all observed
                behaviors in domestic fires. The basic assumption of the approach is that people
                react to a fire by evacuating, and that the time to evacuate is mostly independent
                of the fire. But these assumptions break down for domestic fires. A different
                approach is warranted for fire design for domestic spaces.</abstract>
