      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">U.S. copyright laws do not allow government-owned government-operated
                (GOGO) laboratories of Federal agencies to obtain copyright protection for the
                software products they develop. This report provides an assessment of the likely
                economic effects of allowing copyright protection for software products created in
                the GOGO laboratories. The report uses a formal survey of Federal agencies GOGO
                laboratories and government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) laboratories to
                describe their software development and licensing activities over the past five
                years and to make forecasts about the effects of eliminating the copyright
                prohibition. The survey responses indicate that if copyrights for government-created
                software are allowed, the availability of the software for use by others will
                increase dramatically. Forecasts of the economic impacts of the expected increase in
                the available software are made using estimated models of licensing revenues and
                licensing costs for the survey respondents. The forecasts for the respondents are
                extrapolated to their parent Federal agencies and then to all Federal agencies.
                Information about the economy-wide impact for the software industry is combined with
                the information about the software activities of the Federal agencies to project
                economy-wide benefits of lifting the restrictions on copyrighting software developed
                by GOGO laboratories. Changing the copyright law to allow copyright protection for
                GOGO software is expected to have a positive economic impact on the U.S. economy
                because the software made available will increase the productivity of its users.
                This report provides a first look at software activity that has not previously been
                systematically tracked and reported.</abstract>
