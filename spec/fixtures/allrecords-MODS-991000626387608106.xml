      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In early October 2016 Hurricane Matthew crossed North Carolina as a
                category 1 storm with some areas receiving 15-18 inches of rainfall on already
                saturated soil. The NIST-funded Center for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning
                (Center) teamed with researchers from NIST's Community Resilience, Disaster Failure
                Studies, and Applied Economics programs to conduct a quick response field study
                focused on the small city of Lumberton, NC and the flooding experienced from the
                Lumber River. Approximately one year later, the Center and NIST team returned to
                Lumberton to document and better understand Lumberton's recovery progress with an
                emphasis on housing, businesses, schools, community and state-level decisions, and
                the intersection of these sectors in community recovery. This type of investigation
                is critical for the study of community resilience as it will ultimately provide
                longitudinal recovery data and analyses to support guidance and recommendations on
                what is needed to enable communities the ability to recover more quickly and
                equitably, and more generally, what attributes make most communities more resilient
                to natural hazards. This second in a series of community resilience-focused field
                studies is presented herein as Wave 2 of the on-going Lumberton, North Carolina
                Flood of 2016 report series. Wave 2 had two major objectives: First, to document
                community interdependencies ; and secondly, to document the progress of Lumberton's
                recovery. Both of these objectives support data needs for understanding resilience
                and recovery. Wave 2 dealt primarily with the recovery process of the most heavily
                affected households and businesses through systematic surveys. Analysis revealed
                that even after 14 months, Lumberton is only in the early stages of
                recovery.</abstract>
