      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report sets out to answer three questions. What effect does
                installing smoke detectors have on reported fires and casualties for the average
                household? How much of an effect would increasing smoke detector utilization have on
                the total number of fires and casualties in the United States? And what are the
                attributes of homes currently without smoke detectors and where are they located? We
                estimate the installation of smoke detectors in homes without them reduces the
                expected number of fires reported from a (formerly) non-smoke-detector residence by
                a factor of 3.5 to 5, and reduces the number of expected casualties by a factor of
                2.5 to 3.5. Unexpectedly, we find the number of casualties per reported fire is
                lower for non-smoke- detector households compared to smoke-detector households. This
                could be due to changes in people's behavior when they have a smoke detector in the
                house or because the less dangerous fires are preferentially extinguished when smoke
                detectors are present. If smoke detectors were installed in all residences, the
                number of fires reported to the fire department could be reduced by 25 % or more.
                More realistically, each percent increase in smoke detector penetration reduces
                reported fires by more than 2.6 %. Finally, estimates of smoke detector utilization
                at the census tract level were developed for the entire country. We find evidence
                that the number of homes with smoke detectors are lower than current estimates that
                rely on telephone-only survey interviews. We estimate actual smoke detector usage is
                likely below 92 %. It seems likely that this is due to a correlation between phone
                presence and smoke detector utilization.</abstract>
