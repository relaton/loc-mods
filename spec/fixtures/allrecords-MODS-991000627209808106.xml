      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In recent years, planar near-field antenna measurements have been
                developed and used in a number of applications. One of the primary concerns with
                this, or any, measurement approach is the accuracy of the results; that is, how do
                errors in measured near field quantities affect the accuracies of far-field
                parameters such as gain, sidelobe levels, monopulse difference level, beam width,
                etc. Some efforts have been made in the past to estimate these errors, but the
                results have been limited in generality and primarily of a qualitative nature. A
                two-fold approach is used in this study to obtain equations giving reasonable
                upper-bound errors resulting from systematic errors in the near-field measurements.
                The strategy has been to derive error expressions from the equations relating near
                and far field quantities and also to computer simulate errors using actual measured
                near-field data. The simulation has both given some direction to, and confirmed the
                results of the analysis. The errors which have been investigated are: x, y, and
                z-position errors of the probe, amplitude and phase uncertainties of the measured
                data, and multiple reflections between the probe and test antenna. The results not
                only give the effects of errors in a given quantity, but also specify the form of
                the error (i.e., linear, quadratic, periodic, etc.) which will produce the largest
                effect in the far-field parameters. This information is very valuable in designing
                the measuring equipment so that these types of errors can be avoided, or
                minimized.</abstract>
