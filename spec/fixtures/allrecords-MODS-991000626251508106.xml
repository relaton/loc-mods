      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This study analyzes the potential economic impacts from
                implementation of the new tornado load requirements in the ASCE 7-22 Standard:
                Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures, by
                incorporation into the International Building Code (Proposal S63-22 in Ref. [3])
                and/or direct adoption by Federal, state, and local governments. The Standard
                requires that Risk Category III and IV buildings located in the tornado-prone region
                (approximately equal to the area of the conterminous U.S. east of the Continental
                Divide) be designed to resist tornado loads in addition to wind loads from other
                types of storms. Risk Category III includes buildings that represent a substantial
                hazard to human life in the event of failure (e.g., theaters and other assembly
                occupancies, schools, nursing homes), while Risk Category IV is for essential
                facilities (e.g., hospitals, fire and police stations, emergency operations
                centers). The approach in this study is to (1) identify the potential numbers of
                buildings that may be impacted, (2) compare tornado loads with existing wind load
                requirements to understand when and where tornado loads will control design, (3)
                determine what building elements will require changes in construction design when
                tornado loads control, and (4) estimate the cost of these changes in construction
                design. The adoption of the new tornado load requirements in the ASCE 7-22 standard
                will impact a small fraction of new buildings in the United States. When excluding
                residential occupancies with less than 50 units, the building stock occupancy types
                for Risk Category III and IV buildings in the tornado-prone region represents 15.0 %
                of the entire U.S. building stock and 18.3 % of the building stock in the
                tornado-prone region. These results are effectively upper bound estimates as tornado
                loads will not control over wind loads for all Risk Category III and IV buildings in
                the tornado-prone region. Whether tornado loads control any aspect of the building
                design over wind loads depends on many different climatological and building
                characteristics. Geospatial analyses are used identify the impacts of several of
                these variables. In general, the tornado design requirements will have the most
                impact in the central and southeast U.S. Case studies are used to estimate the
                relative magnitude of the potential cost impacts of five building elements (roof
                systems, roof diaphragm, roof joists and wide flange beams and girders, exterior
                wall framing, and foundation anchorages) for two building types (elementary school
                and high school) for wind Exposure Categories B and C baseline building designs
                across nine locations to provide a range of potential load requirements and
                resulting cost implications. The results of the case studies show that tornado loads
                can vary significantly, from less than wind loads to more than double the wind
                loads. Tornado loads will not control for many locations and building types,
                particularly those on the periphery of the tornado-prone region. For scenarios in
                which the tornado loads do control, the construction design is often not influenced.
                Of the nine cities considered in this study, three realize cost increases for at
                least one exposure category for the elementary school and six for the high school.
                Of all the building type location exposure combinations (36), only six (three for
                each building type) realize cost impacts greater than 0.07 % of the project
                budget.</abstract>
