      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Neural Style Transfer (NST) is an application of neural networks that
                allows one to create an image that has the content of one image and the style of
                another image. For example, NST can be used to create an image of a cat in the style
                of Van Gogh’s \emph{Starry Night}. This study asks two distinct questions. Can we
                use NST to manufacture pseudo crime scene images of shoe impressions by transferring
                the style of a crime scene image to a clean impression of a shoe? The idea is that
                the known, clean image will be transformed to take on the characteristics of a crime
                scene image, thereby providing a mechanism for researchers to generate pseudo crime
                scene images that can be used, for example, in training impression recognition
                algorithms. This is useful because there is a shortage of ground truth known crime
                scene-like data. We report that our NST procedure does not produce extremely
                convincing pseudo impressions but the results are nonetheless promising. The second
                question asks if we can improve crime scene/suspect shoe impression comparison by
                using NST as a preprocessing, sharpening step. The idea is that the “style” of
                well-defined edges of the clean impressions will be transferred to the crime scene
                image. We have a lineup of clean shoe impressions containing the impression of the
                shoe that created the crime scene image and several other impressions of shoes of
                the same make, model, and size. We compare the crime scene image to each of the
                shoes in the lineup using an algorithm that computes similarity scores. The matching
                shoe should give the highest score with high probability. Next, we combine the crime
                scene image with an aggregate image of all the clean shoe impressions in the lineup
                using NST. Then we repeat the comparison process with the NST image instead of the
                original crime scene image. We observe that, in half of the cases we studied, when
                we compare the NST image to each of the shoes in the lineup, we can more readily
                distinguish between the matching shoe and the non-matching shoes than when we do the
                comparisons with the original crime scene image.</abstract>
