      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">A series of measurements was conducted using a bidirectional probe to
                characterize the upward speed in the plumes of medium-scale pool fires burning a
                variety of gaseous and liquid fuels. Time-averaged local measurements of the upward
                velocity were conducted in the plumes of methanol, ethanol, and acetone pool fires
                burning in a 30 cm diameter liquid pool burner and methane and propane gaseous pool
                fires established on a 37 cm diameter gas burner. The gas-phase thermocouple
                temperature was measured separately using many kinds of fine bare-wire thermocouples
                with different data acquisition rate, which temperatures were corrected considering
                radiative loss and thermal inertia effects. The bidirectional probes were connected
                to multiple pressure transducers with various time responses, ranging from 20 ms to
                160 ms. A 25 ?m wire diameter, bare-bead, Type R or S, thermocouple with an
                approximately spherical bead of diameter 125 ?m was positioned about 0.5 cm upstream
                of the probe. The time series of temperature was corrected for radiative loss only.
                The Bernoulli equation was solved using the time series of pressure, the corrected
                temperature time series, and the calculated K factor based on the Re (and its
                properties) calculated from the instantaneous velocity and temperature. The spatial
                separation between the probe and thermocouple was assumed to be of negligible
                importance. The experiments were typically repeated 2 to 3 times and the results
                were repeatable to within a few percent. The upward component of the velocity on the
                plume centerline in the methanol pool fire compared favorably to previous
                measurements and Baum's plume velocity correlation. The results showed that the
                upward velocity increased with distance above the plume for about 1 to 2 diameters
                above the fuel surface and then decreased with distance. The upward component of the
                velocity on the plume centerline in the methanol pool fire compared favorably to
                previous measurements and followed the general trends of Baum and McCaffrey's plume
                theory. A single location radiative heat flux measurement was used to determine the
                radiative fraction in 30 cm diameter methanol pool fires. The results were favorably
                compared to previous measurements using multi-location and single-location heat flux
                measurements.</abstract>
