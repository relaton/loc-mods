      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This User s Manual is associated with the DAD_ETABS vesion 1.0
                software based on the Database-Assisted Design (DAD) procedure for the design of
                high-rise steel buildings for wind, used in conjunction with the structural analysis
                and design program ETABS. For the design of structures for wind ETABS has so far
                been used in conjunction with static wind loads specified by building codes or wind
                engineering laboratories. The marriage of DAD with ETABS significantly enhances the
                capabilities of both programs. DAD allows the direct use of wind-tunnel measurements
                of time-varying pressure coefficients to determine the time-dependent wind loading
                induced by any directional wind speed. Structural and dynamic analyses performed by
                ETABS determine the dependence of any desired building response (i.e., member
                Demand-to-Capacity Indexes (DCI), inter-story drift ratios, floor accelerations) on
                wind speed and direction. Representations of this dependence, called response
                surfaces, are properties of the structure independent of wind climate. They are used
                to transform the matrix of the wind velocities at the building site into response
                matrices for as many responses as are required for structural design purposes. The
                elements of a response matrix are responses induced by their counterparts in the
                wind velocity matrix. For any response being considered, the vector whose components
                are the largest entry in each row of the response matrix is a data sample of the
                largest responses induced in the structure by the elements of the wind velocity
                matrix. The N-year response is obtained from that sample by using any appropriate
                extreme value estimation tool. The DAD_ETABS version 1.0 software was developed for
                the design of steel prismatic structures with rectangular shapes in plan. The User s
                Manual includes an example of the application of the software.</abstract>
