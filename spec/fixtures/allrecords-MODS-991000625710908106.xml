      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Turbulent flow around an axisymmetric hill at Reynolds number Re H ?
                1.3 10 5 with respect to the hill height is studied using resolved large-eddy
                simulations (LES). The purpose of the paper is to examine the effect of turbulence
                in the inflow boundary condition on the flow around the hill. To this end LES
                simulations were performed for the following inflow boundary conditions: (i) mean
                turbulent boundary-layer profile obtained experimentally, and (ii) unsteady
                turbulent velocity profiles from a precursor LES, with the mean profile of the
                precursor LES forced to agree with experimental results, all other flow parameters
                in the two simulations being identical. Comparisons with reliable experiments
                available in the literature showed that the flow, in particular the complex
                separation dynamics in the lee-side of the hill, is sensitive to the inflow boundary
                condition. It was found that the mean flow and turbulence statistics in the
                turbulent-inflow simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results both
                upstream and downstream of the hill. However, the steady-inlet simulation yields a
                thicker and longer separation region than was observed experimentally. Consequent
                recovery of the flow downstream is also delayed where an inner vortex rotating in
                the same direction accompanies an outer vortex in either side of the midspan plane;
                the inner vortex pair is not obtained in either the experiment or the
                turbulent-inflow simulation. Despite these significant discrepancies, the
                upstream-side flow and the separation location for both simulations are in
                reasonably good agreement with the experiment. This can be attributed to the fact
                that the pressure gradient set by the geometry dictates the separation initiation
                through the formation of an internal layer. Incoming turbulence in a simulation
                suppresses the separated shear layer by increasing the near-wall velocity gradient,
                thereby causing early reattachment as in the experiment.</abstract>
