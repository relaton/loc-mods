      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The Computer Security Division at the National Institute of Standards
                and Technology is interested in promoting the security of implementations of
                cryptographic primitives. This security depends not only on the theoretical
                properties of the primitives but also on the ability to withstand attacks on their
                implementations. It is thus important to mitigate breakdowns that result from
                differences between ideal and real implementations of cryptographic algorithms. This
                document overviews the possibility of implementing cryptographic primitives using
                threshold schemes, where multiple components contribute to the operation in a way
                that attains the desired security goals even if f out of n of its components are
                compromised. There is also an identified potential in providing resistance against
                side-channel attacks, which exploit inadvertent leakage from real implementations.
                Security goals of interest include the secrecy of cryptographic keys, as well as
                enhanced integrity and availability, among others. This document considers
                challenges and opportunities related to standardization of threshold schemes for
                cryptographic primitives. It includes examples illustrating security tradeoffs under
                variations of system model and adversaries. It enumerates several high-level
                characterizing features of threshold schemes, including the types of threshold, the
                communication interfaces (with the environment and between components), the
                executing platform (e.g., single device vs. multiple devices) and the setup and
                maintenance requirements. The document poses a number of questions, motivating
                aspects to take into account when considering standardization. A particular
                challenge is the development of criteria that may help guide a selection of
                threshold cryptographic schemes. An open question is deciding at what level each
                standard should be defined (e.g., specific base techniques vs. conceptualized
                functionalities) and which flexibility of parametrization they should allow.
                Suitability to testing and validation of implementations are also major concerns to
                be addressed. Overall, the document intends to support discussion about
                standardization, including motivating an engagement from stakeholders. This is a
                step towards enabling threshold cryptography within the US federal government and
                beyond.</abstract>
