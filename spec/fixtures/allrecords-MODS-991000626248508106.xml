      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Transactive energy may provide a way to support integration of
                customer distributed energy resources (DER) into the electric grid and to help
                manage DER flexibility to support distribution system and bulk grid needs. Use of
                DER flexibility includes peak shifting in response to forward market prices,
                real-time regulation in response to 5-minute prices, and, potentially, voltage
                regulation in response to distribution nodal prices. The work presented here
                compares two approaches for managing heat pump cooling to provide grid services. The
                first approach implements a rule-based real-time controller that manages power
                consumption based on 5-minute real-time prices. The second controller uses a
                model-based approach to optimize load based on day-ahead hourly prices. These
                approaches are evaluated on two reference grids using GridLAB-D with the same
                weather and price information. The real-time controller reacts to a volatile price
                signal to reduce homeowner energy use and energy costs. The model-based controller
                minimizes energy use by pre-cooling before the price peak and allowing indoor
                temperature to drift up during peak price times. The model-based controller strategy
                results in cost savings when temperatures are allowed to move farther from the
                desired setpoint. Because this controller does not respond to real-time price
                volatility, there are no cost savings during sub-hourly real-time price spikes.
                Simulation results show both controllers adjusting temperature setpoints in response
                to price movement, reducing customer cost while staying within pre-defined comfort
                boundaries. These temperature adjustments resulted in significant power flow
                volatility at the substation. The average power flow change for the real-time
                controller, time step to time step, was approximately 10 % of the peak load. Some
                observed power flow changes were equivalent to simultaneously turning off or on all
                price-responsive loads on the grid. This power flow volatility resulted in voltage
                volatility at customer meters and greatly increased voltage regulator and capacitor
                bank actions on one of the tested grids. Analysis suggests that power flow
                volatility may be expected when many devices are price-responsive and controllers
                have the goal of reducing cost without considering voltage. Care must be taken to
                reduce the volatility of the price signal and boost hosting capacity to support
                synchronized price response by a large percentage of load.</abstract>
