      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">With the newly created Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network,
                the public safety community is in the process of supplementing the use of land
                mobile radios with the use of a broader spectrum of technologies. As these
                technologies are being developed, researchers and industry alike need to focus on
                the end users - the first responders - in order to ensure successful and usable
                systems. Understanding the user population of first responders is key to improved
                usability. The NIST PSCR Usability Team conducted a multi-phase, mixed methods
                research project in order to provide greater understanding of public safety users,
                their experiences, and their technology needs and problems. This report, Phase 2,
                Volume 2, is the second in a series of reports on the data from the Phase 2
                large-scale, nationwide survey of 7 182 first responders. Three specific topics in
                the first responder communication technology space, drawing on data from both Phase
                1 and Phase 2 of the project are presented: 1) mobile devices, apps, and software,
                2) futuristic technology and virtual reality, and 3) technology used in large
                incidents. Findings suggest that broader access to affordable devices, particularly
                work-issued smartphones, and data through smartphone apps, most essential being
                email and mapping/navigation, could fill significant gaps in the public safety
                technology space, making the NPSBN build-out so important for public safety. It is
                also important to understand that what many first responders want for the future of
                public safety is technology that already exists for the general public, it just is
                not yet widespread in the public safety domain, e.g., single sign-on (SSO). Lastly,
                researchers and developers in the public safety domain should focus on solving the
                problems that first responders have with technology used for daily incident
                response, as it will also help them during large events.</abstract>
