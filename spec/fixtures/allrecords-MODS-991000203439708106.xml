      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In today's structure fires, evolving fire loads and higher heat
                release rates mean that fires grow larger and faster than ever before. Firefighting
                personal protective equipment (PPE) can be subjected to these severe thermal
                conditions repeatedly during firefighting operations. The self-contained breathing
                apparatus (SCBA) is a critical component of PPE that isolates the firefighter from
                hot and potentially toxic gases and particulate, present as byproducts of
                combustion. In recent years, changes in NFPA standards have resulted in the
                introduction of new SCBA facepiece designs and materials. However, the facepiece
                lens is still often considered the weak-link of the firefighting ensemble. SCBA
                facepiece lenses from two editions of the NFPA 1981 standard around which
                significant new tests were introduced were exposed to repeated thermal loads similar
                to those that could be encountered on a fireground (5 kW/m2 for 5 minutes for 100
                cycles, and 10 kW/m2 for 1.5 minutes for 10 cycles). Samples from subsets of these
                SCBA were subjected to quasistatic tensile tests and dynamic impact testing and
                compared to samples from new, unexposed facepieces. Identical facepiece samples were
                subjected to the NFPA 1981 Lens Radiant Heat Test that was introduced in the 2013
                version of the standard, which drove much of the change in facepiece design.
                Finally, facepiece lenses were tested for potential off-gassing that was proposed to
                be the result of polycarbonate decomposition from typical fireground thermal loads,
                due to the concern that these gasses could be inhaled by the firefighter wearing the
                SCBA facepiece. Statistically significant differences were found between facepieces
                certified to different versions of NFPA 1981. Those lenses certified to the 2013
                edition had higher tensile strength and absorbed more energy but were more brittle
                than the 2007 edition materials. Exposure to repeated thermal loads resulted in
                changes to the tensile strength, strain to failure, maximal load, and energy
                absorbed, but the magnitude and direction of change was dependent on the thermal
                exposure and lens model. However, regardless of model and previous thermal exposure,
                all facepieces were able to maintain positive pressure after being exposed to the 5
                minutes at 15 kW/m2 that is included in the Lens Radiant Heat Test. Off-gas testing
                from the SCBA facepiece lenses showed no measurable polymers being released under
                typical and extreme fireground conditions using the GC-MS technique employed.
                Chemically dissolving the lens material confirmed that bisphenol A was a primary
                component of the polycarbonate along with important polymer chain terminators, and
                trace amounts of other polymers used in scratch resistant and thermal
                coatings.</abstract>
