      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This report presents the experimental design and results of a series
                of localized fire tests on structural steel I-shaped beams. A total of nine tests
                were conducted in the National Fire Research Laboratory, including thermal tests
                (Tests 1 through 5) and four-point bending tests at ambient (Test 6) and elevated
                temperatures (Tests 7 through 9). The specimens were nominally 6.2-m long W16x26
                beams made of ASTM A992 steel. Each specimen was vertically supported with either a
                (i) simple support condition, or (ii) double-angles bolted to laterally braced
                support columns. The thermally-loaded specimens were exposed to fire generated using
                a natural gas burner. The burner had an area of 1 m2 and was located 1.1 m below the
                bottom flange of the beam at midspan. A four-point flexural loading scheme was used
                to apply concentrated forces at two locations 2.44 m apart around midspan. The
                recorded data included temperatures, heat release rates from the burner, and
                structural measurements including forces, displacements and strains. The
                repeatability of several measurements was evaluated. The test results indicated that
                the heating rate of the specimen was sensitive to the prescribed heat release rate
                versus time relationship used in each test. However, the thermal gradient developed
                in the fire-exposed cross sections of the beam never achieved linearity under the
                localized fire exposure. When the exposed (bottom) flange temperature was maintained
                to 616 °C, the load-bearing capacity of the simply-supported beam was reduced to 67
                % of its room-temperature capacity. When the same simply-supported beam was
                initially loaded to 67 % of its room-temperature capacity and then exposed to a
                growing (t-squared) fire, the exposed flange temperature of the beam at failure was
                663 °C. When the beam specimen was supported by double-angle connections and
                subjected to the same bending moment, its fire resistance (failure temperature) was
                decreased to 90 % of that of the simply-supported beam. Regardless of the connection
                types and fire conditions (steady-state or transient-state fire), the beam specimens
                failed by lateral torsional buckling with rapidly increasing vertical
                displacements.</abstract>
