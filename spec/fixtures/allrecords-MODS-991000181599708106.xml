      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Rheological measurements are often performed using a rotational
                rheometer. In this type of rheometer, the tested fluid is sheared between two
                surfaces, one of which is rotating [1]. Usually, an angular velocity is imposed on
                the fluid (through the rotating surface) and this angular velocity determines the
                shear rate the fluid is subjected to. The response of the material is monitored by
                the measurement of the resultant torque on the shaft of the rheometer; this torque
                can then be converted to shear stress. In order to calibrate a rheometer, a standard
                oil of known viscosity should be tested in the rheometer to verify that the
                instrument is operating correctly. However, these standard oils are expensive; which
                makes it impractical for use in calibrating with the rheometer with a large capacity
                as needed for concrete. Additional, these standard oils that are not suspensions
                (i.e. they do not have solid particles suspended in the media), and thus using them
                may not capture some issues that may occur in a suspension rheology. Therefore, a
                relatively inexpensive, reference material is needed that incorporates aggregates
                for concrete rheometers. As concrete and mortar are non-Newtonian, the reference
                material should also be non-Newtonian. This report follows the development and
                serves as re-certification of a Standard Reference Material (SRM) for cement paste
                [2]. A multiscale approach will be utilized to develop SRMs for mortar and concrete
                in the future. The SRM 2492 will be the matrix fluid for a mortar SRM that will in
                turn become the matrix fluid for a concrete SRM. The report SP 260-174 Rev.2012 [2]
                describes how this SRM 2492, a Bingham Paste Mixture for Rheological Measurements
                was developed and provides all the details on the various ingredients. After an
                inter-laboratory study under the sponsorship of the American Concrete Institute
                (ACI) committee 238, Workability of Fresh Concrete, it was found that the
                instructions provided to prepare the SRM were inadequate to obtain reproducible data
                in all laboratories. Thus after establishing a better preparation method, new
                instructions were drafted and it was found that the certified values were no longer
                valid. Thus, it was necessary to redo a series of testing to obtain a new certified
                value. This report provides all measurements obtained, the calculation of the new
                rheological characteristics and the statistical analyses.</abstract>
