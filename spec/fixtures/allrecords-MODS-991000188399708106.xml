      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Homeowners and builders have increasingly strived to build low energy
                homes. As building materials, equipment, and methods have improved and renewable
                energy systems have become commonplace, the goal of net-zero energy homes has become
                technologically viable. Such an example of these capabilities is on display in the
                NetZero Energy Residential Test Facility (NZERTF), located at the National Institute
                of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. While the NIST NZERTF
                has shown that net-zero energy performing homes are technologically feasible using
                conventional technologies, questions related to costs continue to arise. Economic
                performance evaluation is reliant on accurate construction cost data, which may
                change significantly over time as industry learns how to implement energy-efficiency
                measures into building design and more energy-efficient technology diffuses into the
                marketplace. In order to update the underlying data in NISTs economic analysis, a
                NIST-funded contract was completed to estimate the costs of building components
                designed to meet current Maryland building energy code based on 2015 IECC as well as
                higher efficiency building components that are either currently installed in the
                NZERTF or will be installed in the NZERTF in the near future. The purpose of this
                study is to summarize the cost estimates generated by the outside contractor. These
                estimates will then be compared to those from multiple existing data sources.
                Findings from this study will help provide a reasonable range of cost estimates for
                different building components that can be used for future research related to the
                low- and net-zero energy building designs in particular, research related to the
                NZERTF and the Building Industry Reporting and Design for Sustainability (BIRDS)
