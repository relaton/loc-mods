      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) in partnership
                and cooperation with the NIST Office of Weights and Measures (OWM) and the Weights
                and Measures Divisions of select U.S. States initiated the 2022 National Survey on
                20 lb LPG (Propane) Cylinders that represents the current marketplace practice of
                manufacturing, filling, selling and exchanging 20 lb LPG cylinders. The survey
                determined the accuracy of the stamped tare weight (TW) to the actual tare weight by
                collecting contemporary data; evaluated the methods of sale, fill procedures, and
                price posting practices used at direct sale refilling locations; and determined the
                net weight compliance when performing a cylinder exchange and how much product
                remains after consumers perform an exchange. This study was designed to examine,
                validate, and ultimately ensure Equity in the Marketplace, by confirming accuracy
                and fair competition in commercial transactions of LPG products based on product
                weight or other measures (e.g., flat fees). For all the evaluated cylinders (9,482
                new and 822 used cylinders), nearly half (44.3%) of new cylinders and significantly
                less (32.0%) of used cylinders were in compliance with existing tare weight
                requirements. With a shift to more lenient DOT regulations to be enacted on January
                1, 2023, nearly all of these new cylinders (98.4%) and a significant majority of the
                used cylinders (65.7 %) would be in compliance. A total of 1,559 direct sale
                refilling locations across 18 states were evaluated to determine how 20 lb propane
                cylinders were being sold, posted or advertised, and if the safe fill level was
                being verified through proper procedures. A range of selling approaches (by weight,
                volume, flat fees) were observed, and nearly 10 % of locations are improperly
                verifying the safe fill level of cylinders. Of the cylinder exchange locations that
                were surveyed, only 75% passed the overall individual package requirements for
                accurate net contents and 1.1% of cylinders were found to exceed the safe fill level
                of 20 lbs. An average of 25 % of consumers return more than 1 lb of propane when
                they return a cylinder. Of these, approximately 8% returned cylinders with over 5
                lbs of propane. The results provided in this report are to assist and inform the
                States, propane industry, consumer and workplace protection organizations, and
                Federal agency stakeholders of the present needs and opportunities to establish
                improved procedures and oversight of the manufacturing, refilling, reselling and
                consumer-based transactions for LPG cylinders. States should consider performing
                more routine inspections and enforcement beyond the 20 lb cylinders, as similar
                issues and concerns may exist for different sized cylinders and other types of
                compressed gasses. States should review and develop programs to ensure the accuracy
                of scales being used at the plant and at direct sale refilling locations. Industry
                and their trade associations should also consider conducting a root cause analysis
                to determine any underlying processes or procedures that may be contributing to
                non-compliance. Improving the manufacturing process and safety considerations while
                also informing and educating consumers on potentially wasted product will ensure
                improved safety and marketplace equity for businesses and consumers
                alike.</abstract>
