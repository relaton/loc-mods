      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Due to the significant life-safety and economic loss resulting from
                extreme, low probability, high consequence weather events such as Hurricane Katrina,
                Hurricane Sandy, and the Joplin tornado, greater focus has been placed on increasing
                the resiliency of buildings to decrease these impacts. Investigations of building
                performance following tornadoes and hurricanes have shown that wind-borne debris,
                including loose aggregate, gravel, and stone surfacing on roofs are significant
                contributors to building damage and occupant injuries. Buildings may often
                experience little to no structural damage, but suffer failure of exterior glazing,
                causing catastrophic damage to building interiors and building contents that can
                also result in injuries and fatalities. A recent proposed code change to the
                International Building Code (IBC) would prohibit installation of loose aggregate
                surfacing on roofs of Risk Category III or IV buildings located in the most
                tornado-prone region of the country (covering portions of the Great Plains, Midwest,
                and Deep South) in order to reduce the wind-borne debris hazard, particularly to
                glazed openings. Existing building codes already have provisions prohibiting the use
                of roof aggregate to reduce wind-borne debris hazards in hurricane-prone regions
                (IBC 2015, Section 1504.8), and expansion of similar provisions in the tornado-prone
                region are those currently being considered. However, the economic impacts of these
                proposed code changes to prohibit the use of roof aggregate in tornado-prone regions
                are not currently well understood. Needed is an assessment of the impacted building
                stock and the magnitude of associated costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze
                the potential economic impacts from adoption of this proposed change to the IBC by
                identifying the fraction of roof construction that could be impacted from the
                restriction on aggregate surfaced roofs, characterizing alternatives to
                aggregate-surfaced roofing systems, and estimating the costs associated with these
                alternative roofing systems. The results are presented using both a national and
                regional perspective, including a comparison of the impacts from the restrictions on
                aggregate in the hurricane-prone regions. The results demonstrate that the code
                change would potentially impact less than 0.1 % of all roof construction in the
                U.S., and less than 3.0 % of all non-low rise residential roof construction in the
                tornado-prone region. This includes roofs of newly constructed buildings and
                reroofing projects. The previously adopted code change that similarly prohibited
                aggregate-surfaced roofs in the hurricane-prone region impacted more than four times
                as much roof construction. It is found that few roof construction projects will be
                negatively impacted from a construction cost perspective by the proposed restriction
                on aggregate in the tornado-prone region (&lt;0.2 %) because cost-effective
                alternatives are available for most assemblies. Common types of aggregate-surfaced
                roofing that would be prohibited under the proposed code change can be more
                expensive than similar alternatives. For example, built-up roofs with aggregate
                surfacing are found to cost more than the alternative system that replaces the
                aggregate with a cap sheet. For single-ply roof systems over a steel roof deck,
                aggregate ballasted EPDM is also found to be more expensive than mechanically
                attached EPDM. Only in the case of the single-ply systems over a concrete roof deck
                are aggregate ballasted EPDM systems found to be less expensive than the alternative
                EPDM systems. These results hold for all 33 cities studied within the tornado-prone
                region.</abstract>
