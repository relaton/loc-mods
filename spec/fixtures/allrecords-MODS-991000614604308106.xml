      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">RP 10 allows federal agencies to identify conditions in an existing
                building that may pose unacceptable seismic risks to the agency in case of
                undesirable performance of the building during an earthquake. Agency exposure to
                unacceptable risks is generally determined through a seismic evaluation and risk
                assessment of the building. RP 10 provides triggers for a seismic evaluation for
                project circumstances such as major alterations, additions, or repairs, as well as
                change of use or leasing requirements. Evaluation necessitated by triggers is
                referred to as the mandatory process. RP 10 additionally addresses risk awareness by
                having agencies proactively implement evaluations based on inventory screening,
                which is independent of passive trigger requirements identified in the mandatory
                process. This process is referred to as the screening process. RP 10 provides
                circumstances to assist an agency in developing a screening process. RP 10 also
                identifies buildings exempt from seismic evaluation. RP 10 provides the minimum
                seismic performance objective for evaluation of existing buildings owned or leased
                by the Federal Government. The basic performance objective is based on risk to
                occupant safety in a large, rare earthquake by total or partial collapse of the
                building. Higher performance objectives are provided that can be used to assess the
                risks of loss of operative systems, extended re-occupancy and recovery time, or
                economic losses. RP 10 references model building codes published by the
                International Code Council as well as national consensus standards published by the
                American Society of Civil Engineers to provide the basis for defining seismic
                performance objectives, evaluation procedures, and, where necessary, retrofit
                criteria.</abstract>
