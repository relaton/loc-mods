      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">In response to the work-related fatality at the National Fire
                Research Laboratory on September 26, 2022, the National Institute of Standards and
                Technology (NIST) initiated a planned, two-step process to understand the causes of
                the incident and identify actions necessary to prevent future incidents. Incident
                investigation and development of an incident corrective action plan. The
                investigation was conducted by staff from the NIST Office of Safety, Health, and
                Environment and the NIST Engineering Laboratory. The focus was on identifying the
                causal factors, root causes, and contributing factors of the specific incident.
                Corrective actions were developed to address the deficiencies identified, as well as
                other recommendations for NIST leadership to consider. The results of this effort
                are presented in Part A of this document. Executive Team review and development of a
                NIST-level corrective action plan. Subsequently, a subcommittee of NISTâ€™s Executive
                Safety Committee assessed the report and considered the NIST-wide applicability of
                the corrective actions identified. The Executive Review Team extended corrective
                actions and recommendations, as necessary, to ensure sufficient breadth, depth, and
                sustainability of these actions across NIST. Their work is included in Part B of
                this report. Through these two activities, NIST shall strengthen its safety
                management system and address existing shortcomings in its safety culture to protect
                the safety and health of all staff.</abstract>
