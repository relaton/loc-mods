      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Environmental concerns are driving regulations to reduce the use of
                hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential (GWP) as refrigerants
                in heat pumps. CO2 is an attractive alternative refrigerant because is it
                'environmentally friendly' in terms of 'direct' emissions, with GWP = 1, and no
                ozone depletion potential (ODP). However, CO2 heat pumps generally have a lower
                efficiency than HFC-based systems, and therefore have higher 'indirect' emissions,
                related to generating the electricity that powers them. The indirect emissions dwarf
                the direct emissions for most heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration
                applications, so it is critical for the equipment to operate with high efficiency.
                CO2 air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) provide cooling with particularly low efficiency
                at high ambient temperatures where the CO2 operates in a transcritical cycle. Using
                CO2 in a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) offers the potential to overcome the low
                efficiency since a GSHP operates with lower heat-rejection temperature (for
                cooling), enabling the system to operate some of the time in a more-efficient
                subcritical cycle. This report details the laboratory tests of a prototype
                residential liquid-to-air ground-source air conditioner (GSAC) using CO2 as the
                refrigerant. The tests were performed in an environmental chamber and followed the
                ISO 13256-1 standard for rating GSHPs. The CO2 GSAC operated either in a subcritical
                or a transcritical cycle, depending on the entering liquid temperature (ELT). The
                test results included the coefficient of performance (COP), capacity, sensible heat
                ratio (SHR), and pressures. The system incorporated a liquid-line/suction-line heat
                exchanger (LLSL-HX), which was estimated to cause a COP penalty of (0 to 2) % for
                ELTs ranging (10 to 25) C, and benefit of (0 to 5) % for ELTs ranging (30 to 39) C.
                The CO2 system was compared to a 'low-cost', commercially-available R410A-based
                GSHP. With ELTs ranging (10 to 39) C the CO2 system cooling COP ranged (7.3 to 2.4),
                whereas the R410A system values ranged (6.1 to 3.2). At the 'standard' rating
                condition (ELT 25 C), the CO2 GSAC cooling COP was 4.14 and the R410A GSHP COP was
                4.57. At 'part-load' conditions (ELT 20 C) both systems had a COP of ?4.92. Further
                effort is needed to increase the CO2 system efficiency at ELTs greater than 20 C,
                since it underperformed the R410A system in that temperature range.</abstract>
