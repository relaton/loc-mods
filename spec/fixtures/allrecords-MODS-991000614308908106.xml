      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">This document provides an overview of the stakeholder responses,
                consensus and an overarching summary of some of the thematic areas that emerged from
                the Request for Information (RFI). NIST's approach to summarizing the comments
                received in the RFI was to capture the range and breadth of public input, including
                common themes and points of divergence. NIST appreciates the richness of the input
                received from and recognizes that detailed specific comments may not be included in
                this summary. Readers who would like to see the comments in their entirety can find
                those at regulations.gov. The RFI analysis and high-level summary was performed by
                the NIST team by categorizing responses by the five RFI topic areas, individual
                questions and corresponding responses when applicable, and respondent and
                organization type. Where applicable, the NIST team also appropriately mapped
                comments from the text of the general responses to specific RFI questions. Where
                applicable, specific suggestions from the responses were reproduced as part of the
                high-level summary.</abstract>
