      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The Corona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound
                effect on the entire world. With the onset of the pandemic in 2020, also started
                various efforts around the world to automate the contact tracing process to increase
                its efficacy. Most of these efforts and the smartphone apps that were developed used
                the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to detect
                proximity between people. This was facilitated by the development of the
                Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) system that made it possible for Android
                phones and iPhones to exchange standardized BLE messages seamlessly so that RSSI
                could be measured by both types of phones. In the summer of 2020, we carried out a
                five-week long BLE RSSI data collection campaign using wearable devices developed at
                NIST and running on a Raspberry Pi platform. The data collection was comprehensive,
                because it included a wide variety of operational scenarios including situations
                where the two devices were not in line-of-site of each other. To the best of our
                knowledge, there are no publicly reported repositories of BLE RSSI data that
                includes non-line-of-site (NLOS) scenarios. Such scenarios are important, because
                they can lead to false alarms in detecting situations where virus transmission
                between two people is possible. The paper presents a classical analytical framework
                for proximity detection in the context of electronic contact tracing for COVID-19.
                We make a distinction between instantaneous and after the fact proximity detection.
                In the former case, the purpose is to instantaneously warn people that they are
                violating social distancing rules. In the latter case, the purpose is to notify
                people after the fact that they had a close contact of certain duration with an
                individual who has tested positive for COVID-19 and was capable of transmitting the
                virus at the time of the contact. We evaluate the performance of various methods for
                instantaneous proximity detection. In after the fact proximity detection, we are
                interested in identifying periods of time where two people were too close to each
                other with no barriers between them. We propose a method that applies the Viterbi
                Algorithm to a time series of BLE RSSI data to solve this problem. The method
                exploits the fact that humans do not move faster than certain speed. In both cases
                of instantaneous and after the fact proximity detection, we show that methods based
                on BLE RSSI data leave a lot of room for improvement. Therefore, the problem of
                proximity detection for electronic contact tracing and blunting the spread of highly
                infectious diseases is far from solved. We also know that the next pandemic is not a
                matter of if but when.</abstract>
