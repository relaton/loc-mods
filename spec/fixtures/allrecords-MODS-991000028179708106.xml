      <abstract displayLabel="Summary">This report describes 3-dimensional (3D) digital image correlation to
                measure the 3D shape, displacement, and in-plane strain field, during testing of
                gusset plate structural connections. Twelve full-scale bridge gusset plate
                connections of various geometries and boundary conditions were tested at the the
                Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (Ocel
                et al., 2012). These experiments are part of the verification of numerical models as
                part of NCHRP Project 12-84 Guidelines for the Load and Resistance Factor Design and
                Rating of Riveted and Bolted Gusset Plate Connections for Steel Bridge. The
                measurements described here are in regards to the tests performed to failure (i.e.,
                maximum load carrying capacity of the connection). During each of the twelve tests
                to failure, a series (typically about 150) of image pairs were taken for subsequent
                digital image correlation analysis. Although all of the image pairs were processed,
                only a very small portion of the results are presented here. It is intended to give
                general access to the overall data set for use by other researchers. Overall the
                measurements, showed reasonable uncertainties on the order of 150 ?m/m of maximum
                in-plane shear strain, and the measured out of plane initial shapes of the plates
                typically matched qualitative inspections of the connections. The layout,
                calibration, and measurement procedure associated with the digital image correlation
                system are described in detail to aid in understanding of the results. The results
                shown here include a sample of the measured and derived variables for one experiment
                at two conditions to inform the reader of the type of data that is available. The
                results also include an abbreviated set of results that show the evolution of the
                out of plane shape and maximum shear strain field at four points in loading from the
                initial condition to failure.</abstract>
