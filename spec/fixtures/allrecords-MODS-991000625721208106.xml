      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Modern building codes and standards are generally focused on
                safeguarding public health and safety by ensuring buildings meet life safety
                performance objectives following an earthquake event. Certain classes of buildings,
                such as hospitals and schools, may be designed to a higher standard to minimize
                disruption. As communities target resilience of their built environment, it is
                becoming evident that life safety performance can nevertheless result in massive
                disruptions for large classes of residential and commercial buildings. It is
                possible to design buildings to provide more rapid restoration of reoccupancy and
                functionality than life safety standards. Recovery-based design is intended to
                support a community's post-earthquake resilience and represents an advancement in
                design practice. This report presents a framework to provide guidance on the
                economic benefits and costs of adopting functional recovery in design practice. A
                unique aspect of the framework is the acknowledgement that benefits from
                recovery-based design are distributed across various community stakeholders (e.g.,
                residents, customers, local government), in addition to stakeholders at the building
                level (e.g., owners and tenants). Thus, the framework carefully details the
                attribution of impacts to the range of stakeholders potentially affected by improved
                building-design criteria. A key objective of the framework is to identify the set of
                potential benefits and costs, impacted stakeholders, and available data and tools
                for quantification. In the process, we identify gaps in measurement science for
                conducting a complete benefit-cost analysis. In addition, we provide a brief case
                study example that illustrates application of the framework.</abstract>
