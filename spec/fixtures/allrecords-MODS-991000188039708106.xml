      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">Rheological measurements of suspensions are often performed using a
                rotational rheometer. In this type of rheometer, the tested fluid is sheared between
                two surfaces, one of which is rotating to generate a laminar flow of the fluid
                between the surfaces (i.e., a Couette flow). Manufacturers of commercially available
                rheometers generally recommend the use of a standard oil of known viscosity to
                verify that the rheometer is operating correctly. However, in the case of concrete
                rheometers, this approach would require large volumes of oil and was deemed not
                economically feasible by two international studies [1] [2]. The conclusion of those
                international studies was that the optimal approach to calibrate concrete rheometers
                would be to develop a non-Newtonian standard reference material (SRM) that contained
                inclusions similar in size to aggregates used commonly in concrete. This could be
                achieved by using a multi-stage approach where each stage corresponds to a different
                level of complexity of the fluid. The first stage would be to create a paste
                reference material, as was done in the SRM 2492 [3]. The second stage would be to
                mimic the mortar phase of a concrete, and SRM 2493 [4], with 1 mm beads added to SRM
                2492, accomplishes that goal. The third, and final stage, is the creation of SRM
                2497 for concrete, with larger beads added to SRM 2493, which is currently in
                development at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). During the
                certification of SRM 2493, it was found that differences in rheometer geometry
                affect the accuracy of the rheological measurements. In order to gain fundamental
                insight about the impact that different rheometer geometries have on measurements of
                suspensions, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on three different rheometer
                families. The analysis included both experimental testing and computer simulation.
                The comparison between the model and rheological results showed that the increased
                viscosity due to the addition of the 1 mm beads to SRM 2492 was significantly higher
                in the Couette model than in the experimental data. It was also determined that some
                geometries, such as a double spiral, resulted in a higher viscosity than a simple
                serrated cylinder or vane. This finding led to the inference that slippage should
                also be considered. Ultimately, this report highlights that industrial rheometers
                experience slippage issues caused by their choice of geometry and their internal
                boundary conditions (free surfaces), and discusses the most accurate alternative
                available for calibrating rheometers.</abstract>
