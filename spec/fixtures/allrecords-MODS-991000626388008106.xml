      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">As we begin to adopt approaches to help the U.S. National Institute
                of Standards and Technology (NIST) become a more inclusive organization, we need a
                way to assess the current level of inclusivity. The extent to which individuals have
                access to information and resources is largely associated with inclusion in the
                workplace, suggesting that analysis of individuals social networks may be an
                important component of this assessment. Network surveys provide a unique lens
                through which a wide range of networks, including networks of collaboration,
                mentorship, and trust, can be studied. As a result of such studies, efforts to
                improve on inclusivity can be directed towards where they are needed the most.
                Herein, we describe the NIST Interactions Survey a data collection tool developed
                for mapping and analyzing personal ego networks of NIST Federal Employees and aimed
                at quantifying the work- and career advice-related networks. In this study, we
                assess inclusivity at NIST through the lens of social network analysis to provide
                NIST with insights about the current work climate. With an overall response rate of
                approximately 25%, we find that the structure of the work- and advice-related ego
                networks provides important insights into the interaction patterns at NIST. An
                analysis of the network data confirms a siloed effect associated with the
                Organizational Unit affiliation of the respondents and their connections in the work
                and advice networks. Interestingly, we find that, while the composition of work ego
                networks tend to be quite aligned with what would be expected based on the workforce
                demographics, interactions in the advice ego networks reveal preferences associated
                with age and gender. In terms of gender, male employees show preference for
                male-dominated advice networks, which is not surprising given our predominantly male
                workforce. For female employees, however, we observe three distinct types of advice
                networks: two capturing strong preferences to seek advice from
                single-gender-dominated networks, be it male or female, and a third one with the
                gender composition quite evenly balanced. In terms of age preferences, we find that
                younger employees tend to seek advice from more experienced colleagues.
                Interestingly, no discernible differences are observed between the networks of
                minority and non-minority employees for either work or advice. Based on these
                findings, we recommend strategies for bridging the silos between the Laboratories
                and the rest of the Organizational Units, nurturing informal connections among
                female colleagues, and mapping employee networks among different minority groups
                (e.g. American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian, Other). Although
                other approaches are possible, we believe that the recommendations proposed in this
                report will be a good start for NIST to become the inclusive organization we aspire
                to be.</abstract>
