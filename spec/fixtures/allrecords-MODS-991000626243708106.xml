      <abstract displayLabel="Abstract">The Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network (NPSBN) is being
                developed to provide a dedicated network for the use of first responders during
                incident response. A wave of new communication technologies compatible with the
                NPSBN is on the horizon, as major research and development efforts continue for
                these technologies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST)
                Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Usability Team investigated the
                contexts in which first responders work, their experiences with incident response,
                and their problems with and needs for communication technology. The team conducted
                an exploratory, sequential, mixed-methods study to gather insights into the
                experiences and needs of first responders. The multi-phase study included in-depth
                interviews with 193 first responders in Phase 1, followed by a nationwide survey of
                7 182 first responders in Phase 2. This report is the tenth volume published from
                this data and provides a holistic understanding of the usability of communication
                technology for first responders. It is unique in that it combines results from both
                Phase 1 and Phase 2 providing an integrated analysis of both the qualitative and
                quantitative data. This integration allowed us to develop overarching themes about
                the problems and needs of first responders, focusing specifically on the barriers
                and facilitators to the adoption and use of communication technology. In this
                report, we discuss how adoption and use of communication technology is impacted by
                first responders' experiences across three themes: technology trustworthiness, user
                autonomy, and frustration. Overarchingly, there is a lack of technology
                trustworthiness combined with low autonomy that often results in frustration for
                first responders. The development of trustworthy technology takes time and relies on
                first responders knowing that their input and experiences matter (i.e., having
                autonomy). The lack of trustworthiness and autonomy has an impact on the acceptance
                and adoption of new technology and the ability of first responders to accomplish
                their primary tasks. This work can be useful for the researchers, designers, and
                developers (R&amp;D) community as it works to improve current and develop future
                communication technology for first responders. It can also aid administrators and
                decision makers (ADMs) in making purchasing decisions and developing policies
                related to communication technology for first responders in their
                departments.</abstract>
